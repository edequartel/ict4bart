<h1>Introduction to Files and Folders</h1>

<p>Before we start talking too much about opening and saving files and creating documents, we need to first understand about how the computer deals with different files and folders. You may not realize it, but everything in your computer is made up of different files. This includes documents that you might create such as text files or music files or emails or anything that you might create yourself. It also includes all the files that the computer needs to do its job. For example, Microsoft Windows has thousands and thousands of files that it needs in order to do its job. So do  all the programs that you need. JAWS has many hundreds if not thousands of files that it uses to do its job. Microsoft Word has many different files. Every program on your computer is simply a collection of different files. When those files are put together and connected in the right way, that's what makes up a program or the operating system like Microsoft Windows. </p>

<p>There are many different types of files that your computer will use. Most of them really don't matter to us because they're the files that make up the operating system and the different programs. The main ones that we're concerned with are going to be the ones that we create or work with such as documents, or presentations such as slide shows, or music files and things like that. But Windows organizes files with something called a file extension. We've mentioned this before, and we went through an exercise in the Basic Training book five telling Windows to display or show the file extensions. If you didn't have a chance to do that, you may want to go back and do that now just to make sure that your computer is set to show file extensions.
File extensions, as I mentioned, are just a way for us and the computer to know what type of file you are dealing with, whether it's a document or an audio file, or a picture, etc. File extensions are generally going to be three- or four-letter combinations such as DOC or DOCX, MP3, JPG, GIF, RTF, or EXE. All of those are examples of common file types. For example, a Word document that you might create in Microsoft Word will probably have a file extension of DOCX. A music file that you might download might have a file extension of MP3 or WAV. Pictures often have a file extension of JPG, GIF, BMP, or PNG. You don't have to memorize all those or even know what they necessarily stand for, but those are just some examples of different file extensions.</p>

<p>For example, if you try to open a file and the file extension is DOC or DOCX then your computer will know that it needs to be opened in Microsoft Word. Or if you open a file that ends with the file extension of MP3, for example, then the computer will know that it needs to open up a music player in order to play the file. You can't open a music file or a song in Microsoft Word. Likewise, you can't open a Word document with text in it in a music player. The file extensions are important because they tell the computer what type of file you're working with, so it will know which program to open it with. </p>

<p>The files on your computer are organized or grouped into folders. The whole reason for folders is simply to provide a structure in order to keep different files organized. If all the files on your computer were all in the same place, you would never be able to find anything or keep anything organized. There could literally be hundreds of thousands of files on your computer depending on how many programs you have installed. You wouldn't want them all to be in the same place. That's where folders come in handy.</p>

<p>Folders are simply there to let you organize and place files in different places so that you can create a structure in a way to keep them all organized. You can think of folders as having a hierarchy. There are folders, and then each folder may have a set of files in it. And each folder could also contain other folders called subfolders. That's a term that we'll be using quite often. The term is a subfolder, and that simply means a folder within another folder. You might think of this kind of like a tree. I will use a tree as an analogy for this example. Now, the main drive on your computer is typically called the C drive. Most drives are recognized by a letter, and most commonly the letter C represents the C drive or the main hard drive where all the files and folders on your computer will typically be displayed. In some cases, you may have a D drive or an E drive, and it just depends on how your computer was created and set up. Going back to the C drive, this is the main hard drive typically for most computers. And you can think of this maybe like the trunk of a tree, so in the C drive you're going to have other folders just like a tree has branches.</p>

<p>Each of the branches, or folders, may also have other branches or folders in them as well. We'll think of branches kind of like folders, and we'll think of the leaves on those branches kind of like files. If we think about a tree you have the main tree trunk, and typically that trunk will have many different branches that go off of that trunk. Each of the branches may have some leaves on it, and it may also have other branches that extend out to have more leaves. There's kind of a hierarchy there. One branch may have some leaves, and then another branch, that secondary branch, may have some more branches and leaves on it as well. Again, files are kind of like the leaves on a tree. Folders are kind of like the branches which keep all those leaves organized and in different places.</p>

<p>Going back to the hard drive of the computer, the C drive is the main drive where all of your files and folders in Windows are stored. That C drive is going to have subfolders in it. There might be ten or fifteen or twenty or thirty different subfolders beneath the C drive just depending on how your computer is set up. Each of those folders is probably going to have many folders and files within it, and then so on and so forth. There could be many different layers. You may be in a subfolder that's ten or fifteen layers down from the C drive. Let's just discuss a quick example. I'll use myself for this example. Let's say that I create a folder on my C drive called Work Files. In that Work Files folder, I might store some different files, but I might also want to have some different subfolders in the Work Files folder and that will allow me to organize things better. For example, I might create a folder called Music, where I would store my music files. I might create a folder called Budget, where I could store different files for taking notes or keeping track of my monthly expenses for budget. I might create a folder called Letters, where I would keep documents or letters that I've written to other people, so I can save them and go back to them later. You can create as many different folders as you want depending on what things you're doing and what things you want to store. In each of those folders, there could be many different files or many different files and other subfolders. It's really up to you as far as how things are organized.</p>

<p>By default, Windows already has a place for you to store files that you typically work with. You don't have to create your own folder for this, but you might want to create subfolders in this main folder that we're going to talk about as well. That main folder that Windows has already created for you is called the Documents folder. The Documents folder is a place that Windows creates to store your files. You can  create subfolders within the Documents folder to keep your files organized and be able to find them easily. That's why we created an icon on our Desktop in an earlier lesson, so that we could quickly and easily find the Documents folder. Inside the Documents folder you can feel free to create files and subfolders as you wish. Now, you don't have to use the Documents folder for this. You can put things anywhere you want on the computer. You can create as many folders and files structures as you want, but the Documents folder is where most people will store most of their documents because it's already created and it's easy to find it.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this gives you a little bit of an idea now about files and folders and how the structure of files and folders works. If it still doesn't all make sense, don't worry about it. As we start to work through some examples, I think that it will make sense. The next thing that we need to do is open WordPad and get some text in WordPad, so that we can practice saving it, creating a file, and then learning how to open those files.</p>

<h2>Saving and Opening Files</h2>

<p>We are now ready to create a file in WordPad and learn how to save it and then open it back up. The first thing that we need to do is go ahead and open WordPad, so I'll start by pressing the Windows key.</p>

<p>JAWS, Search box edit.</p>

<p>And then I'll type out WordPad and press <strong>ENTER</strong> once I find it.</p>

<p>JAWS, W O R D P, WordPad app.</p>

<p>There it is, so I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, Enter, Document - WordPad, Edit.</p>

<p>Now, the WordPad window is open, and my goal here is to get some text into WordPad so that I have a document to save. Now, of course, I could just type some text, and we will be doing that in another example here in a moment. But what I'm going to do for this first example is take one of the JAWS Help messages that you can display in the Virtual Viewer, copy the text, and then paste it into the WordPad document. This will give you some practice doing a few skills that you've learned previously. The text I'm going to get is from the standard Help message when you press <strong>INSERT+W</strong> also. The first thing I'm going to do is press <strong>INSERT+W</strong> to open the JAWS Virtual Viewer window with the Help message in it.</p>

<p>JAWS, Following are useful Windows keyboard commands. To access an Application Menu bar, press ALT.</p>

<p>I pressed <strong>CTRL</strong> to stop JAWS. Now the Virtual Viewer window is open, and there's a Help message displaying several lines of text. In previous examples, you learned how to highlight text, and of course I could use some of those different commands. However, my goal here is to simply get all the text in this Virtual Viewer window. In order to do that all I need to do is press <strong>CTRL+A</strong>, which will highlight all the text in this Virtual window. I'll press <strong>CTRL+A</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, Selected, Following are useful.</p>

<p>And again, I pressed <strong>CTRL</strong> there to stop JAWS. When you press <strong>CTRL+A</strong> to highlight all the text in a window JAWS starts reading it all by default. You can press the <strong>CTRL</strong> key, of course, to stop JAWS from talking. Now that the text is highlighted, I will press <strong>CTRL+C</strong> to copy it.</p>

<p>JAWS, Copied selection to Clipboard.</p>

<p>And now I will press <strong>ESC</strong> to close the Virtual Viewer window.</p>

<p>JAWS, Escape, blank.</p>

<p>The Virtual Viewer window went away, and now focus is back in the WordPad document. All I need to do is press <strong>CTRL+V</strong> as in Victor to paste the text.</p>

<p>JAWS, Pasted from Clipboard.</p>

<p>Next, I'll press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the document just to verify that the text is here.</p>

<p>JAWS, Top of file, Following are useful Windows keyboard commands.</p>

<p>Here's the top of the document where the text is displayed. This is the text of the Help message that just lists out some standard Windows keystrokes that I can press. Now, I'm ready to save this document. You can go to the File menu and scroll down, and find the item called Save. And that's a perfectly good way to access the Save option, but you might want to use a keystroke that is a shorter way to do it. That keystroke is <strong>CTRL</strong> with the letter <strong>S</strong>, Sierra. This is a pretty universal keystroke. It's used in most programs to perform the Save function. I'm going to press <strong>CTRL+S</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, CTRL+S, Save as dialog, Filename Edit combo document dot RTF.</p>

<p>Now the Save As dialog box has appeared. This is a dialog box that has several different controls in it, and its purpose is to allow you to save this file and then, of course, to pick which folder it gets saved in. We're only going to use a few controls in this dialog box. The cursor starts off in the Filename Edit combo. I'll press a JAWS Keystroke, <strong>INSERT+TAB</strong>, to reread the current control.</p>

<p>JAWS, document dot RTF.</p>

<p>This is the File name edit box where you can type in the name of the file. Every file that you create on the computer is going to have to have a name. This is the place where you type that name. RTF is the default file extension for WordPad, and it stands for Rich Text File. Any file that has the file extension RTF is going to be a file that can be opened and edited with the WordPad application. Any time I save something in WordPad, by default it will be saved as an RTF file. I am going to give this file a name. In fact, I'm going to call it, JAWS Help Message. I'm going to type out those three words, and I can put spaces in a filename. I'll type out Windows Help Message.</p>

<p>JAWS, J A W S space H E L P space M E S S A G E.</p>

<p>I typed out JAWS help message and at this point I could just press <strong>ENTER</strong> and the file would be saved. It would be saved as JAWS help message dot RTF. By default, if I did this, the document would be saved in the Documents folder. Remember, we talked about this in an earlier lesson. The Documents folder is a place that Microsoft has already created for you and it is used to store many of your files. Right now, if I were to press <strong>ENTER</strong> the file would be saved in the Documents folder. You can verify this by simply doing one thing. Press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> twice and that will put the cursor in the Files and Folders List view. The Files and Folders List view is a place where you can navigate to the different folders on the computer so you can decide where you want to save the file. When I press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> and focus moves to the Files and Folders List view I can use that to verify where focus is, so I'll know if focus is in the Documents folder. Or if I need to move to another folder then I can do that as well. I'll go ahead and do that now. I'll press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> once.</p>

<p>JAWS, SHIFT+TAB, Name Split button.</p>

<p>You're going to find something when you press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> the first time that's called a Name split button. This is a way that you can organize or change the order, or the layout, of how this Files and Folders List view behaves, but I don't want to do that now. I'm going to press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> one more time.</p>

<p>JAWS, SHIFT+TAB, Adobe.</p>

<p>I heard JAWS say, Adobe. And what you hear at this point will be different depending on how your computer has been set up and what folders that you might already have in your Documents folder. For me, I know that the Adobe folder is the first folder in the Documents folder on my computer. The folders are going to be displayed first, and they will be in alphabetical order. If I were to scroll down right now focus would start moving through whatever folders are here. And then after the folders I would find whatever files are here, whatever RTF files are already here in this folder. The files are in alphabetical order as well. The folders are listed first in alphabetical order, followed by the files in alphabetical order. We'll come back to this and look at how to save files in a different location later on, but what I'm going to do for now is go ahead and press <strong>TAB</strong> twice to move back to where focus was originally, which is in the Filename Edit combo.</p>

<p>JAWS, Name Split button, Filename edit Combo, JAWS Help Message.</p>

<p>It said, JAWS help message. That's the name of the file that I typed in earlier. Now that I know it is going to be in a Documents folder and I've given it a name I can just press <strong>ENTER</strong> to go ahead and save it.</p>

<p>JAWS, Enter. Edit.</p>

<p>Now, the Save As dialog box has disappeared. Focus is back in the WordPad document, and I'll verify the name of the WordPad document by pressing <strong>INSERT+T</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, Title is JAWS help message dot RTF - WordPad.</p>

<p>And there it is, JAWS help message dot RTF. We're going to practice doing this again. In order to do that I'm going to first press <strong>ALT+F4</strong> to close this document. And then we'll open a new WordPad document, create some text in it, and then practice saving it again. I'll press <strong>ALT+F4</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, ALT+F4.</p>

<p>Now, WordPad has gone away. However, I'm ready to open it again to continue practicing. I'll go ahead and do that now.</p>

<p>JAWS, search box edit, W O R D P, WordPad App, Enter, Document dash WordPad, Edit.</p>

<p>Okay, WordPad has opened again. Let's create a document this time where you type some text instead of copying and pasting text from somewhere else. For this example, I'll pretend that I'm creating a document that's going to contain keystrokes that I want to remember to go back and look at later. Basically, I think of it like a note sheet. At the top of the document here on the first line, I'll write a line of text. I'm writing, JAWS commands that I want to remember.</p>

<p>JAWS, J A W S space C O M M A N D S space T H A T space I space W A N T space T O space R E M E M B E R.</p>

<p>Okay, so I have a title at the top of the document. I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong>, and then I will write out a few different commands, each command on its own line.</p>

<p>JAWS, Enter.</p>

<p>The first one that I'm going to put is, <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong> reads the current line. I'll go ahead and type that out now.</p>

<p>JAWS, I N S E R T + U P space A R R O W comma.</p>

<p>The way that I wrote the keystroke is <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong>, and then I put a comma, so that when I'm reading it, I'll be able to have a little pause between the keystroke and the description.</p>

<p>And now I'm typing, reads the current line.</p>

<p>I'll press <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong> to review what I just wrote.</p>

<p>JAWS, INSERT+UP ARROW, reads the current line.</p>

<p>Okay, now I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong> to create a new line.</p>

<p>JAWS, Enter.</p>

<p>And I'll write the next one, <strong>INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong>, reads the entire document.</p>

<p>I'll go ahead and press <strong>ENTER</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, Enter.</p>

<p>Now, I've got a blank line. We will add some more keystrokes to this list in a little bit, but let's go ahead and save it now. I'm going to press <strong>CTRL+S</strong> for save.</p>

<p>The Save As dialog box opened, and now I'm ready to type in the name of the document. I'm going to call this document, JAWS Commands.</p>

<p>I typed out, JAWS commands. I did put a space between the two words, and that's perfectly fine. And if you remember from last time, WordPad was already set to save this in the Documents folder. That's also fine. That is where I want to save it. I'm going to go ahead and just press <strong>ENTER</strong> now, which will activate the Save button. The document will be saved in the Documents folder. I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong> now.</p>

<p>The Save As dialog box went away, and now focus is back in the WordPad document. Let's practice opening a file that you've already saved. Right now, focus is still in this JAWS commands document that I just created, and I'll press <strong>INSERT+T</strong> to verify that.</p>

<p>There's the filename, so I know focus is in the right document. I want to open the file that we created earlier that contains that JAWS help message. The keystroke to open a document is <strong>CTRL+O</strong>, and this is universal in most programs. I'll press that now.</p>

<p>The Open dialog box has just appeared, and this is almost identical to the Save As dialog box. The difference is this dialog box lets me choose the file that I want to open, rather than saving a document. The cursor is in the Filename Edit combo. If you know that you're already in the right folder, and if you know the exact name of the document you want to open, you could just type it here. Now, I don't often remember the exact name that I typed for a document. Typically, I end up using the Files and Folders list so that I can find the document in a list and open it. And that's perfectly fine. The easiest way to get to the Files and Folders list is to press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> two times. I'll go ahead and do that now.</p>

<p>I heard JAWS say, Adobe, and I know this is the first subfolder within the Documents folder on my computer. Yours will likely be something else. I know focus is already in the Documents folder. Now I can simply scroll down, and I'll find the different files in this folder that WordPad can open.</p>

<p>JAWS, Audacity, Camtasia, Camtasia Studio.</p>

<p>Those are all subfolders on my computer within the Documents folder. I have quite a few folders and files on my computer, so I'm going to press the first letter of the file name I am looking for. I'll press <strong>J</strong> to see if I can find any files or folders that begin with that letter.</p>

<p>Aha! There's a file called JAWS commands dot RTF. That's the one that we just created that I saved. I know that it's a file because I hear JAWS read the file extension at the end, dot RTF. Let's listen to it again.</p>

<p>JAWS, JAWS commands dot RTF.</p>

<p>Now, when I pressed <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong> JAWS read several things. It gave me when the file was created, and it told me what type of file it was. And it even gave me the size of the file. The main piece of information, though, that I am interested in is the filename, JAWS commands dot RTF.</p>

<p>I'm going to press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>, however, because this is not the file I am looking for.</p>

<p>JAWS, JAWS help message dot RTF.</p>

<p>OK! There's the JAWS help message RTF file that we created earlier.</p>

<p> I'll go ahead and just press <strong>ENTER</strong> on it now and it will open.</p>

<p>I know WordPad is still open, and I just switched files. I can press <strong>INSERT+T</strong> to verify that.</p>

<p>JAWS, Title is JAWS help message dot RTF dash WordPad.</p>

<p>I'll just read the first couple of lines.</p>

<p>JAWS, Following are useful Windows keyboard commands. To access an Application Menu bar, press ALT. To open the Start menu, press CTRL+ESC or the Windows key.</p>

<p>Okay, so I just looked at the first three lines there. I know this is the right file. I can do whatever I want, whether I want to read it or make edits or add things to it. Let's practice opening a file again, though. Now, I want to go back and open the file we just created a few minutes ago, the JAWS commands file. The first thing I want to do is press <strong>CTRL+O</strong> to bring up the Open File Dialog box.</p>

<p>JAWS, CTRL+O, Open dialog, Filename edit combo.</p>

<p>I'm going to press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> two times to get to the Files and Folders list.</p>

<p>JAWS, Name split button, Adobe.</p>

<p>And now I'll press the letter <strong>J</strong> until I find the file that I'm looking for.</p>

<p>There it is, JAWS commands dot RTF. I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open it now.</p>

<p>And I'll verify by reading the top line.</p>

<p>JAWS, JAWS commands that I want to remember later.</p>

<p>And I'll just scroll down.</p>

<p>JAWS, INSERT key+UP ARROW, reads the current line. INSERT+DOWN ARROW, reads the entire document. Blank.</p>

<p>And then I have my blank line. I only put in two keystrokes so far. Well, let's add one or two more, and then we'll practice saving it again. I've entered <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong> and <strong>INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong>, but let's do <strong>INSERT+LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> as well, which you know reads each word, one word at a time, left or right. I'm going to put in <strong>INSERT+RIGHT ARROW</strong> first.</p>

<p>I typed, <strong>INSERT+RIGHT ARROW</strong> there. Now I'll type, moves to and speaks the next word. I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong> now to go to the next line. And then I'll type, <strong>INSERT+LEFT ARROW</strong> after that. Next, I'll type, moves to and speaks the prior word. I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong> now.</p>

<p>I just added two more lines of commands. Now, to save this document I can press <strong>CTRL+S</strong> here. The difference is this time instead of bringing up the File Save As dialog box where I had to give the file a name, it will just go ahead and save the document because it already has a name. I named it earlier, JAWS commands. I'll press <strong>CTRL+S</strong> right now.</p>

<p>And JAWS says, <strong>CTRL+S</strong>, but no dialog box popped up. No message popped up. WordPad simply saves the document. Sometimes people ask, Well, why doesn't JAWS say something else here? Well, the reason is because nothing else happens on the screen. Saving files with <strong>CTRL+S</strong> is a universal keystroke for saving files, as I mentioned. When the file already has a name, the program will save the file, but nothing happens visually on the screen. There is nothing else for JAWS to read. The file is saved, and I can continue working. It's a good idea when you're working with documents to save them fairly regularly, so that if something happened to your computer, like if the power went off, or the computer had to restart for some reason, you won't lose your work. I tend to save documents very often because it's so easy. All you must do is press <strong>CTRL+S</strong> to save. Now that you've saved the document, you can close it. And then we're going to look at how to open a file from a slightly different perspective. I'll press <strong>ALT+F4</strong> now to close the document.</p>

<p>WordPad did not give me a prompt about saving the document because it was already previously saved and had a file name. However, if I had made some changes and not saved those changes, then when I press <strong>ALT+F4</strong> I would've gotten a message about saving the document. WordPad would have prompted me to save the document if it saw that I had made changes and not saved them before trying to exit. At that point you'll have a Save or a Don't Save button, and you can decide whether you want to save the changes you made or not save those changes.</p>

<h2>Opening and Deleting Files from the Documents Folder</h2>

<p>In the last lesson, you used WordPad to practice opening a document by pressing <strong>CTRL+O</strong>, pressing <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> twice, and then finding the file in the Files and Folders list. This time we're going to use the Documents folder that we created in a previous lesson. We had a lesson for Windows for doing this. If you didn't participate in those lessons, then you may not have this folder on your Desktop. You might want to go back in lesson five on Windows and find those instructions so that you can get this folder here. To find the folder, you want to first move to the Desktop. I will press <strong>Windows Key+D</strong> to move focus to the Desktop.</p>

<p>JAWS announced that I moved to the Desktop. I'll press <strong>D</strong> to find the folder I'm looking for. There it is. You may need to use the <strong>ARROW Keys</strong> or use first letter navigation to find the folder that you have on your desktop for your documents. Once you find it, go ahead and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open it.</p>

<p>A program is now going to open on your computer. It is called File Explorer. This is a program that lets you look at all the files and folders on your computer, and then you can open them if you like. When you pressed <strong>ENTER</strong> on the icon from your desktop, focus opened into a folder that has several subfolders as well as files. I heard that nothing is selected, so I'll press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to select the first item.</p>

<p>The first folder that I've landed on is the Adobe folder. This is a way for me that, as I mentioned earlier, I know that focus is in the Documents folder, because the Adobe folder is the first subfolder within the Documents folder on my computer. I know focus is in the right place. Now I can simply press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key to start moving through the subfolders and any files that are here in the Documents folder. I'm going to use first letter navigation and press <strong>J</strong> because the files we have created during this lesson all start with that letter.</p>

<p>Aha! There's the file that I created earlier called, JAWS commands dot RTF. There's the JAWS help message file that I created earlier as well. Because focus is in the Documents folder via File Explorer, I would see other Documents here that are not related to WordPad. Just be aware that there could be other documents here. You might find PDF files, or Microsoft Word Documents, or even music files, depending on what's on your computer. Let's say that I want to open the JAWS commands RTF file. I'll press <strong>UP ARROW</strong> to go back to it.</p>

<p>JAWS, JAWS commands dot RTF.</p>

<p>And then if I press <strong>ENTER</strong> here it will open this file in the appropriate program. And you know the appropriate program for an RTF file is WordPad. I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, Enter, JAWS commands dot RTF dash WordPad, Edit.</p>

<p>Windows opened the WordPad program, and it opened the JAWS commands document within WordPad. I'll just review it very quickly.</p>

<p>JAWS, JAWS commands that I want to remember later, INSERT key+UP ARROW, reads the current line.</p>

<p>I'll stop there. I don't need to read the whole thing, but I know that this is the correct file that's open in WordPad. Now I could read it, edit it, delete text, or add text, and then when I'm finished, I'll simply press <strong>ALT+F4</strong> to close it. I'll go ahead and do that now.</p>

<p>When I pressed <strong>ALT+F4</strong>, WordPad closed and put focus right back in the File Explorer screen where I was earlier. So now, for example, if I scroll down.</p>

<p>JAWS, JAWS help message dot RTF.</p>

<p>There's the JAWS help message file that I created earlier. Pressing <strong>ENTER</strong> would open the WordPad document.</p>

<p>There are many other organizational type things that you can do from within the File Explorer screen, such as creating folders or moving files in and out of folders. For now, let's go ahead and press <strong>ALT+F4</strong> to close the File Explorer window.</p>

<p>JAWS, ALT+F4.</p>

<h2>Create a Folder and Move Files to the New Folder</h2>

<p>Let's practice creating a new folder and moving some files into it. First, I'll go to the Documents folder on my desktop. I'll press <strong>WINDOWS Key+D</strong> to move focus to the desktop, and then I'll find the Documents folder. Finally, I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open the Documents folder.</p>

<ol>
	<li>With focus in the Documents folder list view, press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+N</strong> to create a new folder. This is a File Explorer keystroke. A new folder appears in the list view on the right side of the screen in edit mode with the words "New folder" selected. If this keystroke does not work for you, you may press <strong>ALT+H</strong> to move to the Home tab of the ribbon, and then the letter <strong>N</strong> to activate the New Folder button.</li>
	<li>Type over the text "New folder" and give this folder the name of <strong>Training Test</strong> now. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> when you finish typing to get out of edit mode.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> to move from the list view to the tree view in File Explorer. I hear focus is on the Documents folder, and I heard that it is at level two.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will press <strong>UP ARROW</strong> to move to This PC on my computer. There it is. Notice JAWS reported it at level one. I will press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> now. There is a folder for 3D Objects on my computer, and I hear it is at level two. I'll continue to press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to explore the items in the tree view here. Some of these will be the same on your computer, but some may be different. That's perfectly fine for now if so. I heard that my local disk drive, OS(C) is closed. I will press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open it. And I will press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to the first folder on my hard drive. There it is, and I hear it is at level three.</p>

<p>You can continue to explore the items in the tree view at your convenience. Let's move to the Documents folder again. Press <strong>UP ARROW</strong> until you find it, and then press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open it.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Press <strong>T</strong> until focus moves to the new folder you just created called <strong>Training Test</strong> now.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> on the Training Test folder to update the list of files on the right side of File Explorer.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the list view on the right side of the screen. Notice that there are no files in the folder. Try pressing <strong>UP</strong> or <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> now. Nothing happens. Also try pressing <strong>INSERT+PGDN</strong> to read the status bar. Do you hear zero items spoken?</li>
	<li>Press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> to go back to the tree view.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>P</strong> until you find <strong>Program Files</strong>, and then press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open it.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>F</strong> until you find <strong>Freedom Scientific</strong>, and then press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open it.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>T</strong> until you find <strong>Training</strong>, and then press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open it.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> until you find the folder for <strong>JAWS</strong>, and then press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open it.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to find the folder for English users, <strong>ENU</strong> now. Note that this folder will be different if you are using an International version of JAWS. For example, Spanish users may find an ESP folder; German users may find a DEU folder, and so on.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> on the ENU folder to update the right-side list of files.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the list view and use the <strong>ARROW KEYS</strong> to select a file or two.</li>
</ol>

<p>For now, just select two or three files. These files are practice files that get installed on your computer when JAWS is installed, so it really does not matter which two or three files you choose. I heard that the first file, Find dot RTF, was not selected, so I will press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to select it.</p>

<p>To select contiguous files, press and hold down the <strong>SHIFT Key</strong> followed by the <strong>ARROW Keys</strong> next. I will hold down the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key to keep the Find dot RTF selected and press <strong>SHIFT+DOWN ARROW</strong> to select the next file below it. So, it's pretty straight forward, you can select contiguous files by holding down the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key and pressing either <strong>UP</strong> or <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> next. For now, I'm going to unselect these by pressing <strong>UP ARROW</strong> alone. So, the only one that is selected is Find dot RTF.</p>

<p>To select non-contiguous files, first press and hold down the <strong>CTRL</strong> key, which I am doing now. Then, use the <strong>ARROW Keys</strong> to move to another file while still pressing the <strong>CTRL Key</strong>, so the <strong>CTRL</strong> key is pressed , the first file, Find dot RTF, is selected. I will hold the <strong>CTRL</strong> key down and press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> again. Let's go down until I find another file three or four down from here. Still holding the <strong>CTRL</strong> key while pressing the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key. Let's say I choose this one, I'll press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> while still holding the <strong>CTRL</strong> key. And let's choose one more. I'm going to continue to hold down the <strong>CTRL</strong> key until I find the Spelling RTF by pressing <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> now. And still holding the <strong>CTRL</strong> key, I'll press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to select this third, non-contiguous file.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Press <strong>CTRL+C</strong> to copy the files to the clipboard, and then press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> to move back to the tree view.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>T</strong> until you find the <strong>Training Test</strong> folder that we created earlier, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong> to update the list of files on the right side.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>CTRL+V</strong> now to paste the files into the Training Test folder. I pressed <strong>CTRL</strong> to stop speech. Focus moved into the list view and all three files are selected. I will press the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to see what is here.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, press <strong>INSERT+PGDN</strong> to read the status bar at the bottom of the screen. Did you hear the number of files in the folder? I heard there are three items in the folder on my computer.</p>

<h2>Rename Files and Folders</h2>

<p>To rename a file or folder, first select the file or folder, and then press function key <strong>F2</strong> next. If focus is on a folder, the entire folder name is selected, so if you want to retype the whole name, simply begin typing. If focus is on a file, the name of the file is selected but the file extension, if visible, is not selected. To edit the name after pressing <strong>F2</strong> use the <strong>ARROW Keys</strong> to move, and then edit as you would in any edit box.</p>

<p>Let's rename the Training Test folder. I am going to press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> to move back to the tree view. Press <strong>F2</strong> to go into edit mode while focus is on the folder. I'm going to type the word "New" at the end of these two words, so I'll move the cursor there to the end of the line. Then I'll press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to insert a blank space, and then I'll type the word New. When finished, press <strong>ENTER</strong> to save the change and get out of edit mode. Focus moved back into the list view on the right side, so I am going to press <strong>SHIFT+TAB</strong> to move back to the tree view, just to verify that it got renamed, and it did.</p>

<p>Use standard Windows keystrokes to delete files or folders, or you may also cut and paste them. We'll talk about the Recycle Bin in the next lesson.</p>

<h2>Delete Files and use the Recycle Bin</h2>

<p>When focus is on a file or folder a press of the <strong>DEL</strong> key sends the selected item or items directly to the Recycle Bin. There is no longer a prompt asking if you are sure you want to do that or not. The files or folders simply disappear when the <strong>DEL</strong> key is pressed. If you accidentally delete a file or folder you can find it in the Recycle Bin and restore it.</p>

<p>To open the Recycle Bin, press <strong>WINDOWS Key+D</strong> to move to the desktop, and then press <strong>R</strong> until focus moves to the Recycle Bin. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open it.</p>

<p>Select a file or folder, or a group of them, and then press the <strong>APPLICATION Key</strong> next. The first thing at the top of the context menu that opens is Restore.</p>

<h2>Practice with Files and the Recycle Bin</h2>

<p>I am going to press <strong>WINDOWS Key+D</strong> to move to the desktop. I will press <strong>D</strong> to find the Documents folder on my desktop, and I will press <strong>ENTER</strong> to go into it.

<ol>
	<li>Let us move focus to the Training Test folder we created earlier. I will press <strong>T</strong> until I find it. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open this folder.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>CTRL+A</strong> to select all three files. I pressed <strong>CTRL</strong> to stop speech.</li>
	<li>Press the <strong>DEL Key</strong> now. These three files disappear, and now they are in the recycle bin where you can recover them if you need to. Press <strong>INSERT+PGDN</strong> to read the status bar.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>WINDOWS Key+D</strong> to move focus to the desktop again, and then press <strong>R</strong> to find the Recycle Bin.</li>
	<li>Next, press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open the Recycle Bin.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the Name split button, which controls how files are arranged. By default, they are arranged alphabetically from A to Z. If you press <strong>ENTER</strong> on the Name split button you can sort the files in reverse order.</li>
	<li>Instead, press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to move to the Date split button. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to sort the files in the Recycle Bin so that the most recently deleted files are easy to find at the top of the list. Press <strong>HOME</strong> to move to the top of the list. And there they are.</li>
	<li>I heard Find dot RTF is selected. I'll hold down the <strong>SHIFT</strong> Key and then select the other two down below it.</li>
	<li>Now, press the <strong>APPLICATIONS Key</strong> to open a context menu. The <strong>Applications Key</strong> may not be present on your keyboard. Some keyboards have one and some keyboards don't. If you don't have an <strong>APPLICATIONS Key</strong> press <strong>SHIFT+F10</strong>, which is what I will do. The first item in the list is Restore.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> now. The three files are now restored to where they were before we deleted them.</li>
	<li>Close the Recycle Bin by pressing <strong>ALT+F4</strong> next. Focus returns to the Recycle Bin. Let's go back into the Documents folder, I will press <strong>D</strong> now. And I will press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open it again. I will press <strong>T</strong> to find the Training Test New folder. And I will press <strong>ENTER</strong> to go into it. Focus returns to the list of training files and folders, and I heard that Find RTF is not selected, so I will press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>, and I will press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> now. And there they all are.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you are finished practicing go ahead and close File Explorer. I will do that now by pressing <strong>ALT+F4</strong>
