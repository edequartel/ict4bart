<h1>Using the Keyboard to Read and Edit Text</h1>

<p>It's time to learn how to use the keyboard to read and edit text. This is a skill set that will stay with you as long as you're using the computer, and it's something that will be useful to you in many different situations. It's also a skill that takes a little bit of time to learn. It may not come very quickly to some of you, and that's perfectly fine. So, if you find yourself frustrated or challenged as you start to go through some of these exercises, don't worry. Just keep up the practice and it will get easier and easier as you start to learn some of these different keyboard commands.</p>

<p>You'll begin by opening the WordPad program. This application will allow you to put some text on the screen and learn how to use different keyboard commands to make JAWS read that text. Press the <strong>WINDOWS Key</strong> to open the Start menu, and then type the word WordPad. JAWS indicates the search results as you type, and you should hear the word "WordPad" spoken. I'll press the <strong>WINDOWS Key</strong> on my computer, and then I'll start typing in the word WordPad.</p>

<p>I heard JAWS say, WordPad app, so I know the Windows search result has located WordPad. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open it.</p>

<p>Press <strong>INSERT+T</strong> to read the title of the window. The WordPad program is now open.</p>

<p>JAWS speaks the words Untitled - WordPad. This is a blank document, much like a blank sheet of paper. You can type text in the blank area. WordPad is a very basic text editing program included with Windows. It allows you to do a little bit of text formatting, and it's very simple to use. For now, let's get some text into this document so you can practice reading commands first. You'll use a JAWS command that will generate a Help message and place it in the Virtual Viewer, which is a screen where JAWS displays text you can read. You'll copy that text and paste it into the blank WordPad document. Don't worry about memorizing these steps or if some of these keyboard commands seem unfamiliar. You'll learn them in a different lesson. But for now, you'll use them to place text in the blank document so you can begin working with reading commands.</p>

<p>I'll press a JAWS command, <strong>INSERT+W</strong>, as in William.  The Virtual Viewer opens, and text is displayed. I pressed <strong>CTRL</strong> to silence JAWS, so it stopped reading the contents of this window. This is a JAWS help message containing several different keyboard commands you could press. Let's select, or highlight, all this text by pressing <strong>CTRL+A</strong>, as in Alpha.</p>


<p>I pressed <strong>CTRL</strong> to silence JAWS. Now that you pressed <strong>CTRL+A</strong> and the text is highlighted, you need to press <strong>CTRL+C</strong>, as in Charlie, to copy the selected text to the clipboard.</p>

<p>JAWS, Copied selection to Clipboard.</p>

<p>JAWS speaks, "Copied selection to Clipboard," so you know this text has been copied. Press <strong>ESC</strong> to close the Virtual Viewer window.</p>

<p>I'll press <strong>INSERT+T</strong> to make sure that focus is back in the WordPad window. Now you need to paste the text from the clipboard, which you can do by pressing <strong>CTRL+V</strong>, as in Victor. Now the text from the Virtual Viewer window in JAWS has been copied and pasted into WordPad, giving you several lines of text you can use to practice with. Just to recap, press <strong>INSERT+W</strong> to open the Virtual Viewer, <strong>CTRL+A</strong> to highlight all the text, <strong>CTRL+C</strong> to copy it, <strong>ESC</strong> to close the Virtual Viewer, and <strong>CTRL+V</strong> to paste the text. Now that you have some text in WordPad, it's time to review it.</p>

<p>First, press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to make sure the cursor is at the top of the WordPad window.</p>

<p>JAWS, Top of file. Following are useful Windows keyboard commands.</p>

<p>JAWS speaks, Top of file, and then reads the top line of text. You can read through all the text in the document by pressing the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> keys to navigate up and down through the text. JAWS reads each line, one at a time. For example, if you press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>, the cursor moves to the next line and JAWS automatically reads it from left to right.</p>

<p>JAWS, To access an application menu bar, press ALT.</p>

<p>JAWS read that line, stopping at the end. If you press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> again, the cursor will move down to the third line on the WordPad window, and JAWS will read that line as well.</p>

<p>JAWS, To open the Start menu, press CTRL plus ESC or the Windows key.</p>

<p>You can continue to do this all the way to the bottom of the document.</p>

<p>When focus gets to the bottom, you'll hear JAWS speak, Press ESCAPE to close this message. If you press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key again, JAWS will repeat this message because there are no more lines of text to read.</p>

<p>JAWS, Press ESCAPE to close this message.</p>

<p>If you want to navigate back up through the message, press the <strong>UP ARROW</strong> key. JAWS will read each line as you move up the page. For now, just press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top of the page.</p>

<p>Now the cursor is at the top of the document. As you just learned, the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> keys move line by line, but what do the <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> keys do? They move the cursor left and right one character at a time. Characters include letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. Press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key to move the cursor one character to the right. JAWS reads each character as the cursor moves to it.</p>

<p>As you press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key, the cursor moves to the right and JAWS reads each character. If you press the <strong>LEFT ARROW</strong> key, the opposite happens, and JAWS speaks each character as the cursor moves to it.</p>

<p>JAWS just read the word Useful backwards as the cursor moved to each letter. To recap, the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> keys move line by line, and the <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> keys move by characters.</p>

<h2>Reading by Word</h2>

<p>Another way to read through the text is to navigate word by word. JAWS speaks each word as the cursor moves to it. Use the <strong>INSERT</strong> key if you're using a desktop computer and <strong>CAPS LOCK</strong> key if you're using JAWS in laptop keyboard layout, along with the <strong>LEFT</strong> or <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> keys. If you're using a desktop keyboard use your thumb to hold down the <strong>INSERT</strong> key, and then use the four or six on the NUM PAD as <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> keys. If you're using a laptop, you might use your left hand to hold down the <strong>CAPS LOCK</strong> key, and then press the <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> keys with your right hand. You can also use the regular <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT</strong> arrow keys when holding down the <strong>INSERT</strong> as well. For example, if you hold down <strong>INSERT</strong> and press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong>, JAWS speaks: Windows. Keyboard. Commands. Each time you press the <strong>INSERT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong>, the cursor moves to the right one word. You'll hear JAWS speak it. Likewise, if you navigate backwards with the <strong>INSERT</strong> and <strong>LEFT ARROW</strong>, the cursor will move to the left one word at a time, and JAWS will speak it. Keyboard. Windows. Useful.</p>


<p>Each time you use these commands to navigate one word at a time, the cursor is placed at the beginning of the word. For example, if JAWS spoke the word Useful, the cursor is going to be on the letter <strong>U</strong> which is the first letter of that word. You can also read the current word using a keyboard command. This command won't move the cursor but will read the word in focus. On a desktop keyboard, press <strong>INSERT</strong> and the number <strong>5</strong> on the NUM PAD. The number five is in the center of that number pad and typically contains a raised dot in the center of the key or tactile horizontal marking at the bottom. If you're using a laptop keyboard, press <strong>INSERT</strong> or <strong>CAPS LOCK</strong> and the letter <strong>K</strong> as in kilo. JAWS, Useful. Useful.</p>

<p>JAWS read the current word which was "useful," and the cursor did not move. It just read the current word. Now that you're on this word, you can give a JAWS command to spell it. Hold down the <strong>INSERT</strong> and press <strong>5</strong> on the num pad twice quickly. JAWS spells the current word. If you're using desktop layout, hold down <strong>INSERT</strong> and press the <strong>NUM PAD 5</strong> twice quickly. If you're using laptop layout, press <strong>CAPS LOCK+K</strong> twice quickly and JAWS will spell the current word.</p>

<p>That's a great way to find out the spelling of a word without using the <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> keys to move through each letter of the word.</p>

<p>Now, if you are using the narrated audio, pause this lesson by pressing <strong>CTRL+P</strong> and take a few minutes to practice what you've learned. Press <strong>CTRL+P</strong> again to resume the narrated audio when you are ready to continue.</p>

<h2>The Say Line and Say All Commands</h2>

<p>You may remember that pressing <strong>INSERT</strong> and <strong>UP ARROW</strong> activates the Say Line command. That tells JAWS to read the current line the cursor is on, and it does it without moving the cursor.</p>

<p>JAWS, Following are useful Windows keyboard commands.</p>

<p>JAWS read the current line without moving the cursor.</p>

<p>You now know about <strong>INSERT</strong> and the <strong>LEFT ARROW</strong>, the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> and the <strong>UP ARROW</strong>, but what about <strong>INSERT</strong> and the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>? That is the Say All command. This command tells JAWS to start reading from wherever the cursor is to the end of the document. That means if you are on page one of a two-page document, when you press <strong>INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong>, JAWS will begin reading from the cursor location through the second page. On the same token, if you had a thousand page document and you were on page ten and you pressed <strong>INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong>, the Say All command, JAWS would keep reading until it got all the way to the bottom unless you stopped it. Use this command to read a document without constantly pressing reading commands. Press <strong>CTRL</strong> at any time to pause reading and <strong>INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong> to resume where you left off.</p>

<p>JAWS, Following are useful Windows keyboard commands: to access an Application Menu bar press ALT. To open the Start menu, press CTRL+ESC or the Windows key.</p>

<p>When you press <strong>CTRL</strong> to pause reading, the cursor is right where you left off. You can rewind or fast forward through text when using the Say All command. For example, if you're reading a book or article and you miss something or you want to hear JAWS reread the last sentence, you can use the <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT SHIFT</strong> keys as ways to rewind or fast forward. For example, when the Say All command is reading text, press the <strong>LEFT SHIFT</strong> key to rewind, skipping backwards through the text. JAWS will reread the current sentence. Press the <strong>RIGHT SHIFT</strong> key to fast forward through the text and JAWS will skip ahead. These commands provide a great way to skip backward and forward through the text while the Say All command is activated.</p>

<p>Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to navigate to the top of the document.</p>

<p>JAWS, Top of file. Following are useful Windows keyboard.</p>

<p>Now, start the Say All command by pressing <strong>INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong>, and press the <strong>LEFT SHIFT</strong> key to rewind, or move backwards through the text. Press the <strong>RIGHT SHIFT</strong> key to fast forward through the text.</p>

<p>These commands are very useful for moving you quickly through text when the Say All command is activated. Remember, that only works after you press <strong>INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong> and the Say All command is reading.</p>

<h2>The Home and End Keys</h2>

<p>Let's talk about what the <strong>HOME</strong> and <strong>END</strong> keys do. That's end as in E N D, not the letter N as in November. The <strong>HOME</strong> and <strong>END</strong> keys move the cursor to the beginning or end of the current line respectively. If you press the <strong>HOME</strong> key JAWS speaks, "Home," and the cursor moves to the very beginning, or far-left edge, of the current line. Likewise, if you press the <strong>END</strong> key the cursor moves to the end, or far right edge, of the line. You already know that holding down the <strong>CTRL</strong> key with the <strong>HOME</strong> key moves the cursor to the top of the document. The opposite of that is <strong>CTRL+END</strong>, which moves to the bottom of the document.</p>

<p>To recap, press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to go to the top, and <strong>CTRL+END</strong> to go all the way to the bottom. Pressing <strong>HOME</strong> by itself moves the cursor to the beginning of the line and pressing <strong>END</strong> by itself moves the cursor to the end of the line.</p>

<h2>Page Up and Page Down</h2>

<p>There are also the <strong>PGUP</strong> and <strong>PGDN</strong> keys, which perform the standard function of moving the cursor up or down by a larger chunk of lines. It depends on the specific program as to how many lines that is at a time, but sometimes that number could be ten, twelve, or twenty. Pressing <strong>PGUP</strong> moves the cursor a good chunk of the screen up vertically and pressing <strong>PGDN</strong> moves the cursor down a good chunk of the screen down vertically. It's faster than pressing the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> keys if you know you must navigate through a lot of text to reach a part of the document.</p>

<h2>Reading Commands Review</h2>

<p>Let's take just a minute to recap what you've learned so far about reading commands. You've used the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> keys to move the cursor up and down a line at a time, and JAWS automatically reads you the line of text where the cursor moves to. You used the <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> keys to move one letter at a time either left or right and as the cursor moves, JAWS reads you the letter it moves to. Then we added the <strong>INSERT Key</strong> with the <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> keys, and that moved the cursor one word at a time to the left or right respectively. Again, JAWS reads the word as the cursor moved to it. You also pressed <strong>INSERT</strong> and the <strong>NUM PAD 5</strong> key to read the current word. If you're using a laptop keyboard, you could press <strong>CAPS LOCK+K</strong> to do this as well. If you press that command twice, JAWS spells the current word. You also pressed <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong> which is the Say Line command, and that made JAWS read the current line where the cursor was located without moving it. You then pressed <strong>INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong>, which is the Say All command, and that made JAWS start reading at the cursor location and continue reading all the way to the bottom of the document without stopping, unless you press the <strong>CTRL</strong> key to stop JAWS. While the Say All command is activated, use the <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT SHIFT</strong> keys to rewind and fast forward through the text. When you're finished, press the <strong>CTRL</strong> key to stop JAWS.</p>

<p>The <strong>HOME</strong> key moves the cursor to the far left edge, or beginning, of the line that the cursor is on and the <strong>END</strong> key E N D, moves the cursor to the far-right edge, or end, of the current line. Adding <strong>CTRL</strong> with those two keys, <strong>CTRL</strong> and <strong>HOME</strong>, you can move to the top or bottom of the entire document. <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> moves all the way to the top of the document. <strong>CTRL+END</strong> moves all the way to the bottom, and JAWS will say top of file or bottom of file respectively.</p>

<p>Take a few minutes and practice these commands. You should have some text on the screen. If you have another place that you'd like to go to find some text to read, then feel free to do that as well. But start getting comfortable with these commands. You can use them quite often as you continue through different lessons. Once you're finished practicing, press <strong>ALT+F4</strong> to close WordPad. </p>

<p>JAWS, ALT+F4. WordPad dialog. Do you want to save changes to document? Save button.</p>

<p>You are presented with a dialog box asking if you want to save the changes. This is because you entered text in this document. Press <strong>TAB</strong> one time.</p>

<p>JAWS, TAB. Don't Save button.</p>

<p>Focus is on the "Don't Save" button. Press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate it. WordPad has closed.</p>

<h2>Basic Text Editing</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll practice using the keyboard to move the cursor around text and edit it. You'll learn how to make changes to words, add in extra words, or just make changes to certain letters in the words. As with prior lessons, you'll use WordPad to enter text, then practice moving around and editing it. Begin by opening the WordPad program. Press the <strong>WINDOWS Key</strong> to open the Start menu and start typing the word WordPad. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open it. Once WordPad is open, you need to type text into the blank document. In the previous lesson, you copied some text from one of the JAWS Help messages, but in this lesson, you'll type the text. Type this sentence, The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Type that sentence now.</p>

<p>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to move to a new line. Type one more sentence here, This happened last Monday. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> now. This moves the cursor to another line which will remain blank. The first line contains the sentence, The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Directly beneath that is the sentence, This happened last Monday. Just as a side note, that first sentence, The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, contains every single letter in the English alphabet. Now you'll move the cursor around the text you typed and make edits to it. Press the <strong>UP ARROW</strong> key to move the cursor up one line at a time. As you do that, you'll hear JAWS read each line.</p>

<p>JAWS, This happened last Monday.</p>

<p>There's the second line. Press <strong>UP ARROW</strong> once more.</p>

<p>JAWS, The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>

<p>Now the cursor is on the first line.</p>

<p>You learned different reading commands in the previous lesson using the <strong>ARROW keys</strong> or using <strong>INSERT</strong> with the <strong>ARROW keys</strong>, and what happens when you press the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> keys or <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong> to read the current line. You'll start by using the <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> keys to review the text character by character. Let's talk about what happens as the cursor moves. Press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key now.</p>

<p>JAWS, H E space.</p>

<p>The cursor just passed over the word "The" and it's on a blank space.</p>

<p>JAWS, Q.</p>

<p>Here's the word Quick.</p>

<p>JAWS, U I C K.</p>

<p>Press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key again.</p>

<p>JAWS, Space. B.</p>

<p>You're now on the word brown. But where is the cursor? When you hear JAWS read a letter, as you're moving the cursor the cursor will be directly to the left of that letter. For example, you just heard JAWS speak the letter B, as in boy. The cursor is to the left of the letter B. If you press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key.</p>

<p>JAWS, R</p>

<p>You hear JAWS speak R. The cursor is now to the left of the letter R.</p>

<p>JAWS, O</p>

<p>Now you heard JAWS speak O. The cursor is now to the left of the letter O. The key thing to understand is when you are moving the cursor around character by character and you hear JAWS speak a character, you know the cursor will be directly to the left of that character. Press the <strong>LEFT ARROW</strong> key to go back towards the left.</p>

<p>JAWS, R B.</p>

<p>There's the B again. You know the cursor is directly to the left of that B. This is important when you want to make edits to the text. If you're going to add new letters or new words, or if you want to erase some text with either the backspace key or the delete key, you'll need to know where the cursor is in relation to the characters around it.</p>

<p>Now let's make an edit by erasing one word and adding a new word in its place. You'll change the word lazy to the word tired, so you'll pretend for just a moment that the dog was not lazy, it was just tired. In order to do this, you need to erase the word lazy and replace it with the word tired. Start by moving the cursor to the word lazy, so you can erase it.
You'll use a technique talked about in the past, <strong>INSERT</strong> or the <strong>CTRL</strong> key with <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to move word by word until you find the word lazy.</p>

<p>JAWS, Fox jumps over the lazy.</p>

<p>There's the word lazy. When you're moving word by word, the cursor is placed at the beginning of each word. Right now, it's directly to the left of the l in the word lazy. Now, press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key to move the cursor past the Y of this word so you can use the <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> key to erase it.</p>

<p>JAWS, A Z Y.</p>

<p>The cursor has been moved past the A and Z, and is now located directly to the left of the letter Y. You need to move one more space to place the cursor after the Y in order to use the <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> key to erase the word lazy. When you press <strong>BACKSPACE</strong>, the cursor erases the letter to the left of where it is currently located. In this case, you'll erase the Y, Z, A, then L. Press <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, Y.</p>

<p>JAWS spoke, Y. The Y has now been erased from the screen. Press <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> again.</p>

<p>JAWS, Z.</p>

<p>There goes the Z.</p>

<p>JAWS, A.</p>

<p>Then the A.</p>

<p>JAWS, L.</p>

<p>Then the L. Now you've erased the word lazy, and you can type its replacement, the word tired, T I R E D.</p>

<p>JAWS, T I R E D.</p>

<p>Now the word tired has been added to the text. Press <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong> to verify this. Let's see how the line sounds now.</p>

<p>JAWS, The quick brown fox jumps over the tired dog.</p>

<p>Now the dog is not lazy any more. The dog is simply tired. Let's try this again. Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move down to the next line.</p>

<p>JAWS, This happened last Monday.</p>

<p>Let's make a change to this line. Instead of, This happened last Monday, let's change it to This happened last Tuesday. You need to erase the word Monday and replace it with Tuesday. For consistency, move the cursor to the beginning of this line since you really don't know the cursor's exact location. Press the <strong>HOME</strong> key to ensure the cursor is at the beginning of the line.</p>

<p>JAWS, Home.</p>

<p>Now you can move across the line word by word until you find the word Monday.</p>

<p>JAWS, happened last Monday.</p>

<p>There it is with the period beside it. Now press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key repeatedly to locate the end of the word.</p>

<p>JAWS, O N D A Y.</p>

<p>Remember, you need to move the cursor one place to the right of the letter Y and JAWS will indicate the cursor is on the period. Once you've verified this, press <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> to erase the Y. Keep pressing <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> to erase the rest of the word Monday.</p>

<p>JAWS, A D N O M.</p>

<p>You've now erased the entire word Monday and can type the word Tuesday in its place. </p>

<p>JAWS, T U E S D A Y.</p>

<p>You don't need to type the period again because you never erased it. Verify what you have on this line by pressing <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, This happened last Tuesday.</p>

<p>Now JAWS speaks, This happened last Tuesday. Let's practice making another change. Move back up to the first line and change the word jumps to jumped. This will change it from present tense to past tense. Press the <strong>UP ARROW</strong> key to navigate to the previous line.</p>

<p>JAWS, The quick brown fox jumps over the tired dog.</p>

<p>Press the <strong>HOME</strong> key to make sure the cursor is at the beginning of the line.</p>

<p>JAWS, Home.</p>

<p>Move across word by word until you find the word jumps.</p>

<p>JAWS, quick brown fox jumps.</p>

<p>There's the word jumps. Press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key to move the cursor to the right of the S.</p>

<p>JAWS, U M P S Space.</p>

<p>Now focus is one letter to the right of the S. So, press the <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> key once to erase it.</p>

<p>JAWS, S.</p>

<p>The S is now gone. Type the letters E D in its place.</p>

<p>JAWS, E D.</p>

<p>Now, press <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong> to verify this line sounds correct.</p>

<p>JAWS, The quick brown fox jumped over the tired dog.</p>

<p>Excellent. You've changed jumps to past tense. Let's make one more edit and add an extra word. Press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key to navigate to the line below.</p>

<p>JAWS, This happened last Tuesday.</p>

<p>Let's add a word to this line. After the word Tuesday, type the word afternoon. The line will then read, This happened last Tuesday afternoon. First, place the cursor at the beginning of the line so you have a starting point.</p>

<p>JAWS, Home.</p>

<p>Now, move across to the right.</p>

<p>JAWS, happened last Tuesday.</p>

<p>There's the word Tuesday. Press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key to move across the word Tuesday.</p>

<p>JAWS, U E S D A Y.</p>

<p>The cursor is on the period, which places it directly to the right of the Y. Because of this, you need to insert a space between the Y and period before typing the word afternoon. Press the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, Space.</p>

<p>Now type the word afternoon.</p>

<p>JAWS, A F T E R N O O N.</p>

<p>Because the cursor is in front of the period, it should move to the right one space as you type each letter, so it remains at the end of the sentence. Press <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong> to verify this line is correct.</p>

<p>JAWS, This happened last Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>And there it is. If you want to practice making some more edits, feel free to pause this lesson to do that now. Otherwise, let's move on to the next lesson and start learning about how to highlight text and use the clipboard to copy, cut, and paste it. When you are finished, go ahead and close WordPad by pressing <strong>ALT+F4</strong> and answer don't save when prompted.</p>

<h2>Selecting, Copying, Cutting, and Pasting Text</h2>

<p>Now that you have learned to create text as well as edit it, it's time to learn about how to select, copy, cut, or paste the text into another place. Start by opening WordPad and typing some text into the blank document. Type this text. The quick brown fox jumped over the tired dog.</p>

<p>JAWS, The quick brown fox jumped over the tired dog.</p>

<p>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> and type, This happened last Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>JAWS, This happened last Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> again to add a blank line.</p>

<p>JAWS, Enter.</p>

<p>If you don't already have some text here like this go ahead and take a few moments and type those lines. The purpose of selecting text is so you can perform some sort of action with it. For example, you might want to copy or cut the text and then paste it somewhere else, or you might simply want to select a block of text and then delete with one keystroke, rather than deleting each letter one at a time. You'll begin by learning how to select text. Move up to the top of this document by pressing <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, Top of file. The quick brown fox jumped over the tired dog.</p>

<p>The cursor is at the beginning of the first line of this document. Selecting text is basically just a matter of using JAWS reading commands that you're already familiar with along with the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key. For example, you can simply hold down the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key and then start pressing the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong>, and the computer will select the text one letter at a time as you press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key. You can use your left hand and hold down the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key, and then with your right hand press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key one time.</p>

<p>JAWS, T selected.</p>

<p>You've highlighted the letter T in the word, The. Press <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> again while holding the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key.</p>

<p>JAWS, H selected.</p>

<p>Again.</p>

<p>JAWS, E selected. Space selected.</p>

<p>And as you continue to hold the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key down and press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> you're highlighting, or selecting text, one letter at a time. You now have the word the and then a space.</p>

<p>JAWS, Q selected. U selected. I selected. C selected. K selected.</p>

<p>Now, you've selected the words the and quick. You have a block of two words selected, and if you were to press a letter on the keyboard or another key like the <strong>DEL</strong> or <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> key, all of this text, these two words, will be replaced by whatever I type. For example, if you press the letter <strong>A</strong> right now, the words, The quick, will be replaced with the letter A, or if I press the <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> key, both words will be deleted. When you are selecting text, you must be careful not to press something by accident because you could end up erasing things or replacing a block of words with something else. Now, let go of the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key. If you press any of the arrow keys without holding down the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key, what you've highlighted will be unhighlighted or unselected. For example, press the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key by itself.</p>

<p>JAWS, space, B.</p>

<p>And now you've started to move on to the word brown. Focus is on the letter B, but the highlight has gone away from the words, The quick, so I've unhighlighted those words because I pressed an <strong>ARROW</strong> key without the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key. Keep that in mind as you're highlighting text.</p>

<p>Another way to highlight text is by selecting one word at a time. Press the <strong>HOME</strong> key to move the cursor back to the beginning of this line.</p>

<p>JAWS, Home.</p>

<p>Now, hold down the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key again and instead of pressing the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> key, add the <strong>CTRL</strong> key, so you're pressing <strong>SHIFT+CTRL+RIGHT ARROW</strong>, three keys.</p>

<p>JAWS, The selected.</p>

<p>You have selected the entire word, The. Press <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+RIGHT ARROW</strong> again.</p>

<p>JAWS, quick selected.</p>

<p>Do it again.</p>

<p>JAWS, brown selected.</p>

<p>And again.</p>

<p>JAWS, fox selected.</p>

<p>You've now highlighted several words, The quick brown fox. And again, if you let go of the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key, and then press one of the <strong>ARROW</strong> keys the words will become unselected or unhighlighted. Here's a quick JAWS command that's useful once you've highlighted some text. If you're trying to verify what you've highlighted or verify what you've selected, you can press a JAWS command and JAWS will read to you the text that is currently selected. The JAWS command is <strong>SHIFT+INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong> and remember <strong>INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong> is the Say All command. If you add the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key to that, <strong>SHIFT+INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong>, JAWS will read the currently selected text.</p>

<p>JAWS, Selection is, The quick brown fox.</p>

<p>JAWS spoke, Selection is, The quick brown fox. Now, press the <strong>HOME</strong> key, which will move the cursor back to the beginning of this line. It will unselect or unhighlight this text.</p>

<p>JAWS, Home.</p>

<p>You've learned how to select text by moving one character at a time as well as by moving one word at a time. Let's select an entire line. The cursor is at the beginning of the line. Select this line by holding down the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key and pressing the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key once.</p>

<p>JAWS, Selected. The quick brown fox jumped over the tired dog.</p>

<p>That selected that entire line. If you press <strong>SHIFT+DOWN ARROW</strong> once more, you'll select the next line as well.</p>

<p>JAWS, Selected. This happened last Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>You now have both lines of text selected. Press <strong>SHIFT+INSERT+DOWN ARROW</strong> to verify that.</p>

<p>Now that you have some text selected, what can you do with it? Remember if you press the <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> key, you will delete all this text. Or if you press any other letter or number, you will replace all of this text with that letter or number you type. Instead, you'll learn about how to copy or cut text.</p>

<p>The concept you're going to learn about now is the clipboard, the Windows Clipboard. You can think of the clipboard as kind of like a shelf or a bucket where you can store things. Typically, you'll be storing text, but you can also store an entire file such as a picture, or a music file, or something else. The clipboard is simply a place where you can store things by copying or cutting them, and then you can paste them when you need them later. Something that is stored on the clipboard will stay there until you either overwrite it by putting something else on the clipboard, or you turn off or reset the computer. Only one thing can be on the clipboard at a time. Now, that can be one or two characters or it can be a thousand pages, but when you copy something to the Windows Clipboard or cut something to the Windows Clipboard, only that one thing will be there at any given time. Right now, you have two lines of text selected, so you can either copy or cut them. There is a definite difference between the two, copy or cut. When you copy something, it will be placed on the Windows Clipboard, but it will also remain where it currently is. Copying essentially makes a copy of what you've highlighted. It doesn't go anywhere, but it will also be placed onto the Windows Clipboard. In contrast, cutting the text means you are taking it away from wherever it currently is and then you're placing it on the clipboard. For example, if you were to cut these two lines of text you have selected, the text would disappear, and it would be placed on the Windows Clipboard. It would be gone from this document. That's the difference. Copying leaves the text where it currently is. Cutting text takes it away from where it currently is. But both actions put the text onto the clipboard, and you can then paste it somewhere else later. In this first example, you're going to copy this text. The keystroke to copy text is very simple. It's <strong>CTRL</strong> and the letter <strong>C</strong> as in copy. Let's press <strong>CTRL+C</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, Copied selection to Clipboard.</p>

<p>JAWS speaks, Copied selection to Clipboard. You know that this text has been copied. Now that you've copied it, you can go somewhere else either in this document or another document and paste the text. Press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key to move to the blank line at the bottom of this document.</p>

<p>JAWS, Blank.</p>

<p>The text you had previously selected is now unhighlighted, and you're on the blank line. Press the <strong>ENTER</strong> key to insert a new blank line here.</p>

<p>JAWS, Enter.</p>

<p>You can paste the text here. In order to do this, you'll press <strong>CTRL</strong> and the letter <strong>V</strong> as in Victor.</p>

<p>JAWS, Pasted from Clipboard.</p>

<p>JAWS speaks, Pasted from Clipboard. Let's review what's in the document now. Press <strong>CTRL</strong> and the <strong>HOME</strong> key to go to the top.</p>

<p>JAWS, Top of file. The quick brown fox jumped over the tired dog.</p>

<p>Now, press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key.</p>

<p>JAWS, This happened last Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>There you have the first two lines you typed and just copied.</p>

<p>JAWS, Blank.</p>

<p>There's the blank line.</p>

<p>JAWS, The quick brown fox jumped over the tired dog.</p>

<p>Now, here is the text you just pasted at the bottom of this document.</p>

<p>JAWS, This happened last Tuesday afternoon. Blank.</p>

<p>Now, you're at the bottom of the document. You have both lines of text inserted twice into this document, one at the top and one at the bottom. Now, let's look at how to cut text. You will erase these two lines you just pasted at the bottom. This will remove them completely. Begin by highlighting them. Scroll up to the first line you want to cut.</p>

<p>JAWS, This happened  last Tuesday afternoon. The quick brown fox jumped over the tired dog.</p>

<p>You didn't go all the way to the top of the document but stopped at the second block of text here. Press the <strong>HOME</strong> key to make sure the cursor is at the beginning of the line.</p>

<p>JAWS, Home.</p>

<p>Press <strong>SHIFT</strong> and the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key.</p>

<p>JAWS, Selected. The quick brown fox jumped over the tired dog.</p>

<p>Press it once more.</p>

<p>JAWS Selected. This happened last Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>This block of text is now highlighted. Press <strong>CTRL+X</strong> as in X-ray, the keystroke to cut something to the clipboard.</p>

<p>JAWS, Cut selection to clipboard.</p>

<p>The text has been placed on the clipboard, but it has also been removed from the document. Let's review the whole document again. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to go to the top.</p>

<p>JAWS, Top of file. The quick brown fox jumped over the tired dog.</p>

<p>Press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key to explore the rest of the document.</p>

<p>JAWS, This happened last Tuesday afternoon. Blank. Blank. Blank.</p>

<p>There's nothing else at the bottom, so the document is back to the way it was before you copied and cut the text. However, that text is still on the clipboard, so you can still paste it wherever you want.</p>

<p>Let's review some of the keystrokes you've just learned. <strong>SHIFT</strong> and the various reading commands will let you select text. For example, holding down the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key while pressing the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> selects, or highlights, one letter at a time. Holding the <strong>SHIFT</strong> and the <strong>CTRL</strong> key while pressing the <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> selects one word at a time. Holding <strong>SHIFT</strong> while pressing the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key selects one line at a time. Another one that you can use is <strong>CTRL+A</strong> to select everything. Use this to select all the text in a document. Once you've selected the text, you can then do one of several things. For example, pressing the <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> or <strong>DELETE</strong> keys remove the text. Or you can type something else to directly overwrite and replace the text. You can also copy or cut the text. <strong>CTRL+C</strong> is the keystroke to use to copy the selection. <strong>CTRL+X</strong> is the keystroke to use to cut the selection. If you would like to paste the text somewhere else, then you need to simply move the cursor to wherever you want to paste it, and then press <strong>CTRL+V</strong>, as in Victor. </p>

<p>Let's practice one more example before we move on. This time you're going to copy some text from one of the JAWS Help messages, and then paste it into this document you created in WordPad. In order to do this, you need to first display the JAWS Help message in the Virtual Viewer. This keystroke is a command that you've used in a previous example. The keystroke is <strong>INSERT</strong> and the letter <strong>W</strong>, which displays a JAWS Help message about some basic commands that you can use in Windows. Press <strong>INSERT+W</strong> to make the Virtual Viewer appear with the Help text in it.</p>

<p>JAWS, Following are useful Windows keyboard commands: to access.</p>

<p>I pressed <strong>CTRL</strong> to stop JAWS from talking. The Virtual Viewer is now open with a JAWS Help message displayed in it. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to move to the top.</p>

<p>JAWS, Following are useful Windows keyboard commands.</p>

<p>Now that the cursor is on the top line of text, press <strong>SHIFT+DOWN ARROW</strong> to select it.</p>

<p>JAWS, Selected. Following are useful Windows keyboard commands.</p>

<p>Now it's selected, press <strong>CTRL+C</strong> to copy it.</p>

<p>JAWS, Copied selection to Clipboard.</p>

<p>Press <strong>ESC</strong> to close this Virtual Viewer window.</p>

<p>JAWS, Escape. Blank.</p>

<p>You're back in the WordPad window. Press <strong>INSERT+T</strong> to verify this.</p>

<p>JAWS, Title is. Document - WordPad.</p>

<p>Move to the bottom of the WordPad document and paste the text you copied. Press <strong>CTRL+END</strong> which will move the cursor to the bottom of the document.</p>

<p>JAWS, Bottom of file. Blank.</p>

<p>There's a blank line here, so  I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong> once more just to insert a new blank line.</p>

<p>JAWS, Enter.</p>

<p>Paste the text by pressing <strong>CTRL+V</strong>, as in Victor.</p>

<p>JAWS, Pasted from Clipboard.</p>

<p>Let's review the document. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to go to the top.</p>

<p>JAWS, Top of file. The quick brown fox jumped over the tired dog.</p>

<p>Press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key to review the rest of the text.</p>

<p>JAWS, This happened last Tuesday afternoon. Blank. Blank. Following are useful Windows keyboard commands.</p>

<p>You have an extra blank line. Did you notice there were two blank lines? Listen again.</p>

<p>JAWS, Blank. Blank.</p>

<p>Let's remove one of them. To do that, place the cursor on one of the blank lines and press the <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> key one time.</p>

<p>JAWS, Blank.</p>

<p>That should've erased the blank line. Now use the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> keys to verify if that blank line is gone.</p>

<p>JAWS, The quick brown fox jumped over the tired dog.</p>

<p>There's the top of my document. Press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key.</p>

<p>JAWS, This happened last Tuesday afternoon. Blank.</p>

<p>There's one blank line.</p>

<p>JAWS, Following are useful Windows keyboard commands.</p>

<p>That second blank line is gone. To recap, if you have a blank line you want to remove, simply put the cursor on it and press the <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> key. In the next exercise, you will learn about the FSClipboard. This is a clipboard feature designed by Freedom Scientific to allow you to copy more than one piece of text on it at a time. It's a very handy tool.</p>

<h2>Using the FSClipboard</h2>

<p>The FSClipboard is a tool developed by Freedom Scientific specifically for JAWS users. It allows you to copy more than one thing to the clipboard at a time. Remember, that the standard Windows clipboard can only contain one block of text at a time. So, for example, if you copy or cut some text to the clipboard and then you go and copy or cut some other text later, it will replace the first block of text that you had. Sometimes, though, it might be nice to have more than one block of text on the clipboard at a time, so you might want to copy several different pieces of information and then paste them all at once somewhere else. That's where the FSClipboard comes into play. Its job is to allow you to copy more than one thing to the clipboard at a time, and then paste all the content together. Let's dive in and see how it works.</p>

<p>I've got the WordPad window still open where we were copying and selecting text before. I'll press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key to make sure I'm at the bottom of the window, and there you will find the help message that we copied from the last lesson.</p>

<p>JAWS, Following are useful Windows keyboard commands.</p>

<p>So, this is the beginning of that JAWS help message that is displayed when you press <strong>INSERT+W</strong>, and what we're going to do now is go copy several of those keystrokes that the help message displays. The first thing you need to do is open that help message again, so press <strong>INSERT+W</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, Following are useful Windows keyboard commands, to access an.  </p>

<p>I'll stop JAWS. Press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong> to make sure the cursor is at the top of this window.</p>

<p>JAWS, Following are useful Windows keyboard commands.</p>

<p>This is a line that we already copied into our document. Press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key now.</p>

<p>JAWS, To access an Application Menu bar, press ALT. To open the Start menu, press CTRL plus ESC or the Windows key.</p>

<p>Now what we have here is there are several lines of text with different keystrokes and what those keystrokes do. What I'm going to do is highlight and copy several of them, and then paste them all together in the document. So, I'm going to scroll down two more times.</p>

<p>JAWS, For Windows Help, press F1. To exit an application, press ALT plus F4.</p>

<p>There's a line right there, To exit an application, press ALT plus F4. Let's say that I want to copy this line. The first thing I'll do is hold the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key and press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key.</p>

<p>JAWS, Selected. To exit an application, press ALT +F4.</p>

<p>Now the line of text is highlighted. I'll press <strong>CTRL+C</strong> to copy it.</p>

<p>JAWS, Copied selection to clipboard.</p>

<p>Now, it's copied to the clipboard. I'll continue to scroll down until I find the next line of text that I want to copy.</p>

<p>JAWS, Press CTRL+ESC, ESC, and then press TAB to cycle between the three.  </p>

<p>I'll keep pressing <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> now.</p>

<p>JAWS, To display a context menu for a selected item, press the Applications key or SHIFT+F10.</p>

<p>OK, let's say that I'd like to copy this line as well. The first thing I need to do is press <strong>SHIFT+DOWN ARROW</strong> to highlight it.</p>

<p>JAWS, Selected. To display a context menu for a selected item, press the Applications key or SHIFT+F10.</p>

<p>Now, at this point, if I were to press <strong>CTRL+C</strong> I would overwrite the block of text that I just copied a few moments ago. I don't want to do that. I want to add this new text and append it to the original text. So, instead of pressing <strong>CTRL+C</strong> I'm going to use a JAWS command which is the command to append text to the clipboard. That will take this line that I've just selected and add it to, or append it, to the other text that's already on the clipboard. The JAWS command to do that is <strong>WINDOWS Key+INSERT</strong> and the letter <strong>C</strong>, as in copy. So, that command again is <strong>WINDOWS Key+INSERT+C</strong>, and I'll press that now.</p>

<p>JAWS, Appended selection to clipboard.</p>

<p>And JAWS said, Appended selection to clipboard. So, it didn't overwrite the clipboard with the new text. It added what I just selected to the text that was already there. Now, I'll press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> once more.</p>

<p>JAWS, To toggle multi-select mode for extended select lists, press SHIFT+F8.</p>

<p>I'll continue moving the cursor down the screen.</p>

<p>JAWS, Blank. Press Escape to close this message.</p>

<p>So, I've copied two lines from this Help message. I'll press the <strong>ESC</strong> key now to close the message.</p>

<p>JAWS, Escape. Following are useful.</p>

<p>Now, focus is back on the WordPad window. I'm going to press <strong>CTRL+END</strong> to make sure the cursor is at the bottom of the document.</p>

<p>JAWS, Bottom of file. Following are useful Windows keyboard commands.</p>

<p>And I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong> to move to the line below.</p>

<p>JAWS, Enter.</p>

<p>Now, to paste the text I will simply press <strong>CTRL+V</strong> as in Victor.</p>

<p>JAWS, Pasted from clipboard.</p>

<p>And what should've happened is both lines of text that I copied, the one that I had originally copied and then the one that I appended, should be there. I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong> to insert a blank line first. So, let's scroll up and find out if they are there.</p>

<p>JAWS, To display a context menu for a selected item, press the Applications key or SHIFT+F10. To exit an application, press ALT+F4. </p>

<p>And there they are. Both of them are there. So, FSClipboard allowed me to select multiple lines of text separately, append them all onto the clipboard, and then paste them all at once. I could've done this for 20, 30, or even 100 things if I wanted to. I just chose to demonstrate a few things to keep the example short. Once you've copied multiple items to the FSClipboard and you try to copy something again via the regular keystroke, <strong>CTRL+C</strong>, JAWS will give you a warning message telling you that it is about overwrite what you've already copied. I'll show you this. I'm going to just highlight some text here in my document. I'll press <strong>CTRL+HOME</strong>. </p>

<p>And then I'll just press <strong>SHIFT+DOWN ARROW</strong> to highlight some text.</p>

<p>JAWS, Selected.</p>

<p>Now I've got some text highlighted. I'm just going to pretend that I want to copy this by pressing <strong>CTRL+C</strong> for copy.</p>

<p>JAWS, [Chime] Overwrite clipboard dialog. Pressing CTRL+C or CTRL+X will overwrite the clipboard. Do you want to continue this operation? Yes button.</p>

<p>This dialog box that appeared is a warning from JAWS. It's telling me that earlier I had appended some text to the clipboard using the FSClipboard command, <strong>WINDOWS Key+INSERT+C</strong>, however, just a moment ago I pressed the generic Windows copy command, <strong>CTRL+C</strong>, and the warning message is asking me if I want to continue. If I press <strong>ENTER</strong> on the Yes button, then the clipboard will be overwritten with the new text that I just copied. The text that I had copied and appended earlier there with the FSClipboard will be gone. And if that's what I wanted to do I could simply press <strong>ENTER</strong> here. However, this warning message helps, because if I had intended to append that new text by pressing <strong>WINDOWS Key+INSERT+C</strong>, but I pressed <strong>CTRL+C</strong> by accident, this is giving me a way out. If I press <strong>TAB</strong> to move over to the No button and activate that, then nothing will happen. Nothing will be copied. So, then I could go back and press <strong>WINDOWS Key+INSERT+C </strong>to append the text. So, to recap, this is the way JAWS warns you. Hey, you are just about to overwrite some text that you may have spent a bit of time appending on the clipboard. Are you sure you want to do that? Because earlier you appended some text. So, it's just a help message to keep me from accidentally appending a bunch of things and then pressing the wrong command, and then erasing all those things. So, I'll press <strong>ENTER</strong>, because I do want to overwrite what was already there.</p>

<p>JAWS, Enter. Copied selection to clipboard. Edit.</p>

<p>And now the new text that I just highlighted has been copied to the clipboard. And that's how you can use the FSClipboard to select and copy multiple items, and then paste them all together at once. I'm now going to press <strong>ALT+F4</strong> to close WordPad. I'll choose Don't Save when prompted. Thanks for joining me in this lesson!</p>
