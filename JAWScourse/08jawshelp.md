JAWS Help - Five Quick Ways to Get Help
=======================================

In this section we will look at five different quick ways to get help with JAWS. They include the following:

*   Windows Key Help
*   Hot Key Help
*   Screen Sensitive Help
*   JAWS Help for Apps
*   JAWS Help System

Windows Key Help, INSERT+W
--------------------------

This keystroke opens the virtual viewer and lists the Windows keystrokes for the current app.

The first type of help we will touch on is called Windows Key Help. The Windows Key Help is a way to get a list of keystrokes that JAWS displays in the Virtual Viewer. Remember the Virtual Viewer is a window that JAWS creates where the JAWS spoken message appears in text. You can move around this virtualized text with the arrow keys and the different JAWS reading commands. You can select the text and copy it as well. Windows Key Help brings up a list in the Virtual Viewer of Windows specific commands that you can use for the current app. And the commands that are displayed in the Virtual Viewer will be context specific, meaning they are based on what program you're using at the time. I'm going to start this demonstration on the desktop. I'm going to press **WINDOWS Key+D** to move focus to the desktop.

Focus is on the desktop, and I'll press **INSERT+W** to bring up a list of generic commands in the Virtual Viewer.

JAWS: Following are useful Windows keyboard commands.

I pressed **CTRL** to stop JAWS from reading. I stopped JAWS because it reads the entire screen at once. Instead, I'll read this screen one line at a time. I'll press **CTRL+HOME** to make sure focus is at the top of the virtual viewer.

I'll press **DOWN ARROW** now.

JAWS: To access an Application Menu bar, press ALT. To open the Start menu, press CTRL+ESC or the Windows key. For Windows Help, press F1. To exit an application, press ALT+F4.

I'll stop there because I don't want to read this entire screen. You can continue to scroll down through this and read it if you'd like. This help message being displayed right now is a list of generic commands that you can use anywhere. For example, JAWS was just speaking about using **ALT+F4** to close a program or pressing the **ALT** key to access the menu bar. Those are concepts that you may already be familiar with. You can review this message with the **ARROW** keys. When you're finished reading it, just press **ESC**, and this message will close.

JAWS: Not selected JAWS 2020, five of twelve.

And now focus has returned to the desktop.

Hot Key Help, INSERT+H
----------------------

This keystroke opens the virtual viewer and lists the JAWS keystrokes for the current app.

The second quick way of getting help in JAWS is hotkey help. Bringing up the list of JAWS Hot Key Help commands brings up a list of JAWS specific keystrokes. The keystrokes which are displayed are dependent on what program you're using. However, all of these are going to be JAWS specific keystrokes that will only work when JAWS is running. The main difference between the Windows Key Help with **INSERT+W** and the Hot Key Help that we are discussing now is the Windows Key Help commands are generic to Windows. It wouldn't matter if JAWS were running or not. You could press those commands. However, the JAWS Hot Key Help commands that we are discussing now only work when JAWS is running. If you have JAWS in desktop keyboard mode, then you will press **INSERT** and the letter **H** as in hotel. If you're using JAWS in laptop mode and you do not have an INSERT key, **CTRL+SHIFT+ CAPSLOCK+H** is the command you press. That sounds like a mouthful but use your left hand and use three fingers to press **CTRL+SHIFT** and **CAPS LOCK** and then press the **H** with your right hand. I'll press **INSERT+H** now.

JAWS: Here are some JAWS Hot Keys for general use.

I stopped JAWS because it would read this entire screen. I'm going to use the arrow keys to read by line.

JAWS: Here are some JAWS Hot Keys for general use.

At the top of the Virtual Viewer window the text mentions JAWS Hot Keys for general use. This is a generic list of commands, and I'll just scroll through a few of them.

JAWS: Description Hot Key. Link screen sensitive help INSERT+F1. Link Windows tips on navigation INSERT+W. Link read window title INSERT+T.

I'll stop JAWS there. I won't read the rest of them. You can continue to scroll down if you'd like to finish reading this list. You'll notice these commands are all generic. They're not tied to a specific app because I was on the Desktop when I pressed this command, I got a generic list of possible JAWS Hot Keys. I'll press **ESCAPE** now to close this message.

JAWS: Taskbar.

Now, focus has gone to the Taskbar. Let's try both commands again, but I'm going to move to an app and then try the commands from within that context and see how they're different. What I'm going to do for this exercise is open a web browser, even though we haven't talked about using the Internet in this training yet. I will venture to the web browser briefly just to show an example. I'm going to go ahead and use the Start menu and open the Chrome browser.

I pressed the **WINDOWS Key** and now, I'll start typing out **Chrome** until I hear JAWS speak it.

And I'll press **ENTER** now.

Once Chrome has opened, let's try the Windows key Help Command again. And remember that is **INSERT+W** for Windows. I'll press it now.

I'll stop JAWS and use the arrow keys and review a few of these help messages.

JAWS: To move forward to the next link or control, press TAB. To move backwards to the previous link or control, press SHIFT+TAB. To activate a link, press Enter.

You'll notice that this list of help messages is very different from the ones that I was reviewing on the Desktop. These help messages are specific to Google Chrome. This tells you that JAWS was able to identify which app you were running when you pressed **INSERT+W** and gives you a list of hot keys related to that specific app . As another example, if I were using Microsoft Word and I press **INSERT+W**, I would get a list of hot key commands specific to Microsoft Word. The same is true for Excel. If I were to press **INSERT+W** while focus is in the Excel app, the list of commands would be related to Excel. If JAWS doesn't have specific commands for the app in focus, you will get the generic list. I'll press **ESC** now to close the Virtual Viewer.

Focus is back in Google Chrome. Let's try the same thing with JAWS Hot Key Help now. Press **INSERT+H** to activate the JAWS Hot Key Help if you are using the desktop layout. Press **CTRL+SHIFT+CAPS LOCK+H** if you are using the laptop layout. Go ahead and press the appropriate keystroke now.

JAWS: Go back a page ALT+LEFT ARROW. Read the Address Bar Insert+ A. Next link TAB.

I went ahead and stopped JAWS after reading several commands. There are many more that you can scroll through, but these commands are specific to JAWS and Google Chrome. Hot Key Help works the same way in that the list of commands that you get is dependent on which app is in focus. If focus is on the desktop, or if focus is in an app where there are no specific JAWS commands, then you get a generic list. I'll go ahead and press **ESC** now to close the Virtual Viewer. And I'll press **ALT+F4** to close Chrome.

Screen Sensitive Help, INSERT+F1
--------------------------------

This keystroke places the current window or control information, what it is used for, and some keystrokes that work in it in the virtual viewer. This keystroke works in all cursor modes.

I'll demo a third way of getting help, called Screen Sensitive Help. To demonstrate this, I'm going to press **WINDOWS Key+D** to move to the desktop. Focus was already there for me. I will press **INSERT+T** to verify this, **INSERT+T** to read the title. Focus is on the desktop. Now I want to move to the Start button. I will press **TAB** to move to the Windows Start button. The Screen Sensitive Help command will again bring up the Virtual Viewer, but instead of a list of keystrokes you will get a description based on where the cursor is. You will also get some information about different things you can do. It is a help message about what you can do based on where the cursor is located. Let's just see how it works. The command is I**NSERT+F1**, so let's press it now.

JAWS: From the Start Button, press ENTER to open the Start Menu, or TAB to move to the Taskbar. The Start menu provides access to applications and Windows utilities. The taskbar lists running applications. List JAWS Hot Keys Press ESCAPE to close this message.

This help message mentioned that focus is on the Start button. It told me that I can use the **ENTER** key to open the Start menu, or the **TAB** key to move to the taskbar, etc. I'll press **ESC** to close it for now.

Let's try it in a different location. I'm going to press **TAB** to move from the Start button to the Taskbar, and I'll press **INSERT+F1** to open Screen Sensitive help there.

JAWS: The task bar contains currently running applications. Press ENTER to make an application active. Running applications may also be listed by pressing JAWSKey+F10. List JAWS Hot Keys. Press ESCAPE to close this message.

This is a help message about the apps running in the Windows Task Bar. I also learned a new JAWS command by listening to this message. The help mentioned **JAWS Key+F10**, which brings up a list of apps running in the task bar. I can use this JAWS keystroke to switch to different apps instead of using **ALT+TAB** if I wish to. I'll press **ESCAPE** to close the virtual viewer for now.

You could use this in several different places. For example, if you're using Google Chrome to browse the web and you press **INSERT+F1**, you'll get a specific message with an overview of the webpage that you're on. If you're using Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel, then you'll get a help message describing the document that you're working in in Word or Excel. Try it and use it frequently to get more information about the current app or control with focus.

JAWS Help for Apps, INSERT+F1 Pressed Twice Quickly
---------------------------------------------------

This keystroke provides JAWS specific help for apps supported by JAWS.

Let's look at one other way to get to the help topic for JAWS and specific apps. JAWS may already have help topic information for many of the apps that you use on your computer. There's an easy way to find out if JAWS has specific help for an app. Let's learn how to do that. I'm going to open Google Chrome. I'll open the start menu and type in Chrome.

Chrome is now open. What I'm going to do now is press **INSERT+F1** twice quickly. So, I'm going to hold down the **JAWS key**, or the **INSERT Key** in my case, and I'm going to press **F1** two times quickly. That's going to open the JAWS help system directly to the help topic for Google Chrome.

I heard JAWS tell me that focus is in a book called popular applications, and focus is on the topic called Google Chrome. Now I can press **F6** to move over to the right side of the screen and read the documentation for the Chrome help topic. You can use **F6** to move from the left side of the JAWS Help system where books and topics are to the right side of the Help system where the help for the selected topic is found. Use **F6** to switch back to the tree view of books and topics whenever you wish.

You're going to find help topics for JAWS and quite a few different apps as I mentioned. I'll press **F6** to move back to the tree view. So, you'll find specific help for apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Adobe Acrobat, Skype and many other different apps.

Now you can scroll up or down through the different books or topics that are there. I'm going to scroll down first. I know there is one called Microsoft Applications, so I will press **M** to find it, and then **RIGHT ARROW** to open the book. Once open, I will press **DOWN ARROW** to move through some of the topics under the book for Microsoft apps.

I'll go ahead and stop there, but you get the point that there are quite a few apps here that have specific help for JAWS. I could press **ENTER** on any of these, and then press **F6** to move to the help information for that app. The easy way though, is when you're in the app simply hold down the **INSERT key**, press **F1** twice quickly. You are taken right to the topic for that app. The JAWS help system can be a great resource for continuing to learn about JAWS. I hope you'll take advantage of it. I'm going to press **ALT+F4** to close out of the help system.

Focus is back in the Google Chrome web browser. I will close it with **ALT+F4** and continue on my way.

JAWS Help System
----------------

Help information for software is often presented in HTML format. You can read and navigate these Help systems just like Web sites on the Internet. A type of help system called HTML Help is used in many kinds of programs, including JAWS. In addition to presenting information as HTML pages, an HTML Help system can also have an index, full text search capability, glossary, table of contents, and other features. In this section, you will learn how to use the comprehensive search and navigation features of HTML Help systems.

For this lesson, we're going to use the Surf's Up training web page topic for the JAWS Help. When you visit the Using HTML Help Systems page of Surf's Up you will learn how to use and work with the following parts of the JAWS and other HTML help systems:

*   Table of Contents
*   Index
*   Searching the Help System
*   Marking Favorite Topics
*   Printing HTML Help Topics
*   Moving Back to the Previous Topic

Please use this link to visit the [Surf's Up HTML Help page](https://support.freedomscientific.com/Training/Surfs-Up/HTML_Help.htm) for the rest of this lesson. When you are finished, remember to close the Surf's Up with **ALT+F4** and continue with the JAWS Basic Training.
