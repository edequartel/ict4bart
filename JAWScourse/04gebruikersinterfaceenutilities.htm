<h1>JAWS User Interface and Utilities</h1>

<p>There are several topics we will discuss in this part of the JAWS Basic Training. Some of these include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The JAWS User Interface and menus</li>
	<li>Voice Profiles and the Add/Remove Voices app in JAWS</li>
	<li>Switching between different voices or voice profiles</li>
	<li>The JAWS Utilities folder and its contents</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview of the JAWS User Interface</h2>

<p>We have already looked briefly at the main menu bar in the JAWS user interface when we discussed how to navigate menus, use access keys and hot keys, open dialog boxes, and more in the last lesson. We won't be discussing every single item in the JAWS user interface in this lesson, but I do want to show you where to find a few of the most common things you might need quickly and easily.</p>

<p>Let's switch to the JAWS window and look. If you are using JAWS in the Windows system tray you can access the menu items by pressing <strong>INSERT+J</strong>. That key combination also works to bring the JAWS window into the foreground if it is minimized or in the background behind another running app. I'll go ahead and press it now.</p>

<p>The JAWS window, or user interface, has a menu bar across the top, as we discussed in the prior lesson. But there is also other information handy right here in the JAWS window, including the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Version number - The current version of JAWS is displayed just below the menu bar. Press <strong>INSERT+UP ARROW</strong>, the JAWS keystroke to read the current line, to hear it.</li>
	<li>Serial number - The serial number is displayed on the bottom line of the JAWS window. Press <strong>INSERT+PGDN</strong>, the JAWS keystroke to read the bottom line of any window, to hear it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, while I won't be going into a lot of detail here in the JAWS Basic Training on the JAWS user interface and JAWS utilities folder, remember you can always get help for the controls in the JAWS dialog boxes by pressing <strong>INSERT+F1</strong> for screen sensitive help. Also, you will find more information for all of these in the JAWS Help System. The main purpose for this section is to show you where some of the most common things you might be looking for can be found.</p>

<h3>Options Menu</h3>

<p>The JAWS Options menu contains the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Basics dot dot dot</li>
	<li>Voices submenu</li>
	<li>Braille</li>
	<li>Manage Application Settings</li>
	<li>Exit</li>
</ul>

<p>The two things I want to show you here are the Basics dialog box and the Voices submenu. I will press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move back to Basics dot dot dot. Focus in the menus just wrapped again from the bottom to the top as we've discussed previously.</p>

<h4>Basics Dot Dot Dot</h4>

<p>The dot dot dot is an ellipsis. Whenever you hear an ellipsis in menus it means that pressing <strong>ENTER</strong> to open this opens a dialog box on the screen. Go ahead and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open the JAWS Basics dialog box.</p>

<p>You saw several things in the JAWS Startup Wizard that are also found here, including this first item, Tutor Messages. I am not changing anything for Tutor Messages, but if you wish to make any changes feel free to do so as you go along. I'll press <strong>TAB</strong>.</p>

<p>Access Keys were discussed in the prior lesson. I will press <strong>TAB</strong>.</p>

<p>The Automatically Start JAWS button here gives you the ability to set JAWS to run first or not, as we discussed in the prior lesson. I'll press <strong>TAB</strong>.</p>

<h5>Prompt to Confirm when Exiting JAWS</h5>

<p>This is a check box, and it is a nice feature which allows you to close JAWS without having to answer the question, "Do you really want to quit?" I am going to press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to uncheck this item. And I will press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the next control.</p>

<p>There is the "Automatic notification of updates" check box. I will leave this as it is, since this is what alerts me every time there is a new release of JAWS. I'll press <strong>TAB</strong>.</p>

<p>This check box for "Run JAWS from system tray" is nice if you want to move JAWS out of the task switching window when you press <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> to switch between running apps. If you check this check box, JAWS only shows up in the Windows system tray and you cannot find it by pressing <strong>ALT+TAB</strong>. I like this feature, and normally, this is how I have JAWS set on my computer, to run in the system tray. Since we are covering several items in the JAWS window in these lessons, I'm going to leave it unchecked for now. If you like having JAWS out of the task switching window, just come back here later and check this check box. For now, I will press <strong>TAB</strong> to move on.</p>

<p>The next item is "Show virtual viewer on screen," and I will leave it checked. You saw the virtual viewer in the last lesson, and you'll be using it more as we go through the training. The default is to have it showing visually, and that's where we will leave it. I'll press <strong>TAB</strong> again.</p>

<h5>Keyboard Layout - Desktop or Laptop</h5>

<p>Here's the combo box for keyboard layout, which we covered in the last lesson. I'll leave it set to Desktop for now, and I will press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the next control.</p>

<p>There are several items here that we will not cover, so I'm going to press <strong>TAB</strong> to move forward to the OK button, and then I will activate it with the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>. I made a change so that JAWS will not ask me if I really want to shut it off when I close it. If you did not make any changes, or if you do not want to save any changes that may have been made by accident, just choose the Cancel button. Choosing Cancel just ensures that if you DID accidentally change something, those changes will not be saved. Of course, if you made one or more changes that you want to save, as I did, please go ahead and activate the OK button instead.</p>

<h4>Voices Submenu</h4>

<p>I want to show you just a couple of things in the Voices submenu. I will press <strong>ALT+O</strong> to open the Options menu once more. Choose the Voices submenu. In the Voices submenu are three items, Voice Adjustment, Select a Voice Profile, and Add/Remove Voices. Let's look at Voice Adjustment first. Notice you hear JAWS announce an ellipsis, dot dot dot, so you know this will open another dialog box. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> on Voice Adjustment. The Voice Adjustment dialog box opens.</p>

<h5>Voice Adjustment Dialog Box</h5>

<p>We just opened the Voice Adjustment dialog box by pressing <strong>ALT+O</strong> in the JAWS window for the Options menu, opening the Voices submenu, and finally pressing <strong>ENTER</strong> on Voice Adjustment in the Voices submenu. Focus is in the Profile Name combo box, with Eloquence selected. Eloquence is the default voice for JAWS unless you or someone else has changed it since JAWS was installed. If you have a different voice, don't worry. We're just looking at some of the basics here.</p>

<p>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move through the different voices available on your computer, keeping in mind that you probably have different things here than I do. As focus moves down the list, give it a second or two and you should hear those different voices speak out loud, so you get an idea of what they sound like. The label for this control, "Profile name," is just another way of saying the "voice synthesizer" you are using along with all the different settings for that synthesizer. In other words, I can have a profile for Eloquence that has the voice rate and punctuation one way or another way. You can create a different profile for any synthesizer. You can create multiple profiles for each synthesizer. So, I might have a profile for proof reading that reads all punctuation to me. The word "profile" simply means a synthesizer and a given set of parameters for that voice such as voice rate, volume perhaps, punctuation, and more. Don't let the term "voice profile" scare you!</p>

<p>Press <strong>HOME</strong> to move back to the top of the list for now. Be sure that the Eloquence voice synthesizer is selected before you continue. I will press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the next control. Here's a Delete Profile button. We aren't going to delete any of the profiles, so keep pressing <strong>TAB</strong> to look at the other items here in the Voice Adjustment dialog box. Some of the other items include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Enable Additional Voice Profiles for installed Vocalizer Expressive 2 voices, check box checked - You want to leave this checked so that you have additional voice profiles for Vocalizer Expressive available. Vocalizer Expressive voices are very nice, natural sounding speech synthesizers. You may like their voice quality better, and we will look at adding more of these later.</li>
	<li>Synthesizer Language: Combo box, Match JAWS UI Language (Primary) - We won't cover this in the basic training.</li>
	<li>Speak Sample button - Pressing <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> on this button plays a sample of that voice.</li>
	<li>Voice Adjust: Combo box, All Contexts - We won't cover this in the basic training.</li>
	<li>Voice Rate: 68, left right slider, 25 percent - Here's another slider bar control. You can adjust the voice rate here in the same way we did in the JAWS Startup Wizard.</li>
	<li>Voice Punctuation: Combo box, most - Remember, in a combo box you can press <strong>UP</strong> or <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to review the possible choices.</li>
	<li>Voice Spell Rate Change Percent: Edit, minus 20 - When you spell a word with JAWS, the voice rate slows down by 20 percent so you can hear the spelled word more clearly.</li>
	<li>Voice Upper Case Pitch Change Percent: Edit, 20 - When focus is on a capital letter, JAWS speaks the letter with a higher pitch, indicating it is a capital.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to make any changes here, feel free to do so. I'm not changing anything now but wanted to show you where these items are in the Voice Adjustment dialog box. We will add a new voice in the next section, so you will have a chance to see how it all works together. There are some buttons available at the bottom of the dialog box. Some may not be available, depending on whether you made any changes or not. They include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>OK</li>
	<li>Save As - which lets you give the profile a new name, like "proof reading," for example.</li>
	<li>Apply</li>
	<li>Cancel</li>
</ul>

<p>For now, if you did not make any changes, just press <strong>ESC</strong> to close the dialog box. If you did make changes and you want to save them, choose the OK or the Save As button, depending on your needs. For now, I will press <strong>ESC</strong>. Focus returns to the JAWS window.</p>

<h5>Add or Remove Voices</h5>

<p>Let's look now at how to add one or more of the newer Vocalizer Expressive voices. The JAWS window is in the foreground. Press <strong>ALT+O</strong> to open the Options menu, and then follow the steps below.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> An Internet connection is required to install the voices.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Press <strong>V</strong> to open the Voices submenu.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move to Add/Remove Voices, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>. The new "Add/Remove Vocalizer Expressive Voices" app opens. Focus is in the "Select a Language" combo box, and on my computer, it is set to English.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the list of Premium Voices. These are all free, high quality voices available for you to use with JAWS, Fusion, or ZoomText. Once these voices are installed for one product, they are also available for the other products mentioned, if you have any of them installed on your computer.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>ALT+P</strong> to activate the "Play Sample" button to hear a sample of each voice.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> in the list to select as many of the voices you want to install. I'm going to choose Moira, an English Irish voice. Notice that if you have any of these voices already installed, this is indicated in the list as well. I will press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to select that one. I will press <strong>ALT+P</strong> to play a sample.
	</li>
	<li>Once you have made your selections, press <strong>TAB</strong> to explore the rest of the dialog box before you install them. There's the "Install Selected Voices" button. It has an access key of the letter <strong>I</strong>, so we can activate it later without having to move back to it. Press <strong>TAB</strong> again. There are two or three buttons available in the Additional options section of the app. They include:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Remove a Voice</li>
			<li>Remove All Voices</li>
			<li>Remove All Compact Voices - Some of you may not have the option for "Remove All Compact Voices" if you have already removed those, which is the case on my computer.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Finally, there is a Close button.</li>
	<li>If you are ready to install one or more voices now, press <strong>ALT+I</strong> to activate the Install Selected Voices button. I will answer "Yes" to the User Account Control which asked if I want to do this. I'll press <strong>LEFT ARROW</strong> to move to the Yes button, and then <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to activate it. The installation begins.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the installation is completed, activate the Finish button. The Add/Remove voices app closes, and focus returns to the JAWS window. Let's open the Add/Remove voices app again to check the results.</p>

<ol>
	<li>In the JAWS window press <strong>ALT+O</strong> for Options.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>V</strong> to open the Voices submenu.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>A</strong> to use the access key to open the Add/Remove voices app.</li>
	<li>When the app opens, press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the Premium Voices list, and then use the <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> keys to explore the changes  you made.</li>
	<li>When you finish, just press <strong>ESC</strong> to close the app. Focus returns to the JAWS window again.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Switching Between Different Voice Profiles</h4>

<p>One of the menu items beneath the Voices submenu that you may have noticed earlier was Select a Voice Profile. So, you could switch to the JAWS window, press the keystrokes we discussed a few minutes ago, and choose Select a Voice Profile there. But that involves a lot of steps, and of course, there is a JAWS keystroke for that! Let's use the JAWS keystroke to Select a Voice Profile together. I'll press it now. The keystroke is <strong>INSERT+CTRL+S</strong>. The Select a Voice Profile dialog box opens. Focus is in the Default combo box, and on my computer, Eloquence is selected. Press <strong>DOWN</strong> or <strong>UP ARROW</strong> to move to the different voice profiles in the list. You should find the same ones that you found when we explored the Voice Profiles dialog box. To switch to a different voice profile, just select one in the Default combo box, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>. That's all there is to it! I will switch to Moira and press a few keystrokes to hear this voice. I'll press <strong>INSERT+T</strong> to read the title of the current window.</p>

<p>For now, I'm going to press <strong>INSERT+CTRL+S</strong> to open the Select a Voice Profile dialog box again. In the Default combo box, I'm going to choose Eloquence again. I'll press <strong>E</strong> and then <strong>ENTER</strong> once focus is on Eloquence in the list. The voice switches back to Eloquence on my computer.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> The second control in the Select a Voice Profile dialog box is a "For" combo box. We won't discuss this in the basic training, so please don't change anything there at this time. Just use the first combo box for "Default" to switch between different voice profiles. Just so you know, however, the second combo box gives you the ability to set a specific synthesizer to launch whenever a given app opens. For example, I could have a different voice profile load every time Notepad opens, and have that voice only be active in Notepad. When I switch to Notepad, the voice starts reading. When focus moves to other apps, the normal voice resumes reading. For more information on this topic, see the JAWS Help System.</p>

<h3>Utilities Menu</h3>

<p>The Utilities menu contains quite a few options, and we will not cover them all in the Basic Training. For those that are not covered in the Basic Training, please visit the JAWS Help system for more information. The ones I want to show you include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>JAWS Tandem</li>
	<li>Screen Shade</li>
	<li>Explore Utilities Folder</li>
	<li>Convenient OCR</li>
	<li>Picture Smart</li>
</ul>

<p>I will press <strong>ALT+U</strong> to move to the Utilities menu.</p>

<h4>JAWS Tandem</h4>

<p>Use JAWS Tandem&trade; to access another computer running JAWS to provide hands on technical support, write scripts from a distance, or perform remote JAWS training. This feature consists of a controller system, used by support personnel, distributors, dealers, consultants, and trainers, and a target system, which is the customer’s JAWS application and computer. If you and I were to do a Tandem session, typically I would take the controller side so that I can see and hear JAWS on your computer, which would be the target computer. A JAWS Tandem connection serves as an online meeting between two JAWS users. A meeting is conducted over the Internet. The primary connection method is through Tandem Center, a gateway server responsible for creating meeting IDs, verifying proper use of JAWS Tandem, and providing a path between the two systems. After the session is established, the controller can manage and run the target system's desktop. For example, I can hear JAWS on your computer and see your computer screen on my screen if I am the controller. I can use my keyboard to drive JAWS on your computer and hear what I am doing. Since I am also sighted, I have the option to visually see your computer desktop on my computer screen as well. So, I usually use both the visual and the speech aspects of JAWS Tandem. It is a great tool for training and troubleshooting!</p>

<p>I'm going to show you a few tips on how to get in and out of JAWS Tandem in case you need to use it for help or training.</p>

<h5>Tandem Quick Start Guide</h5>

<p>First, and foremost, there is a Quick Start Guide for Tandem easily available to you. Here's how to find it.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Make sure focus is in the JAWS window, and then press <strong>ALT+U</strong> to open the JAWS Utilities menu. The first thing you hear is JAWS Tandem submenu.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> or <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> to open the submenu. The first thing in this submenu is another submenu for Tandem Center. Don't open the submenu just yet.</li>
	<li>Instead, press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to explore a few items here. They include:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Tandem Direct submenu</li>
					<li>Disconnect. <strong>NOTE:</strong> This is unavailable now because I am not in an active Tandem session. But here's where to find it. You may also press <strong>INSERT+ALT+T</strong> at any time during a Tandem session to immediately end or disconnect the session.</li>
				<li>Quick Start Guide - Here's where you find the Tandem QSG, or Quick Start Guide. I won't open it now, but feel free to come back and look later. There is much more information here than what I am going to cover in the JAWS Basic Training.</li>
			</ul>
</ol>

<p>For now, just press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> once. Focus wraps back to the top of the menu to Tandem Center submenu.</p>

<h5>Allow Access to my Computer</h5>

<p>If you are not there already, we pressed the following keystrokes in the prior example:</p>

<ol>
	<li>First, press <strong>ALT+U</strong> to open the JAWS Utilities menu, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>. You should hear Tandem Center submenu.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open the submenu. The first item is "Allow Access to my Computer" dot dot dot. Go ahead and press <strong>ENTER</strong> here. A dialog box opens with focus in the Meeting ID edit box. If you and I were having a Tandem session, I would give you a seven-digit alphanumeric code to type in here. It might be something like the following: RD677SA. There will always be two letters, three numbers, and two more letters in the code. Uppercase is not necessary. All you must do is type the code the person who is going to be the controller gives you, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong> to start the session.</li>
</ol>

<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Instead of going through the menus to open the "Allow Access to my Computer" dialog box, you can just press the key combination, <strong>INSERT+ALT+T</strong> to open the Allow Access dialog box. You can also use the same keystroke to <strong>end</strong> the session at any time.</p>

<p>Focus is in the JAWS Tandem Allow Access dialog box on my computer. I will press <strong>ESC</strong> to close the dialog box without starting a new Tandem session. But these are the steps you will need to follow to participate in a Tandem session as a target computer for training, troubleshooting, or more.</p>

<h4>Screen Shade</h4>

<p>Let's look at Screen Shade next. For additional privacy, use the JAWS Screen Shade to prevent others from seeing what you are typing or reading by turning the screen black. This feature is available in Windows 10 and Windows 8.</p>

<p>To turn on the Screen Shade, press <strong>INSERT+SPACEBAR</strong> followed by the <strong>PRINT SCREEN</strong> key, or triple tap with three fingers on a touch screen. Alternatively, Screen Shade can be toggled on or off using Quick Settings (<strong>INSERT+V</strong>). Once enabled, the contents of your screen can no longer be seen. The Screen Shade remains active until toggled back off, or until JAWS is restarted. Screen Shade can also be turned off by doing a right mouse click.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Screen Shade is strictly a privacy feature and will not increase the battery life on a laptop or tablet. Additionally, Screen Shade is only available when JAWS is running by itself. It cannot be used when running Fusion, or when running JAWS together with ZoomText.</p>

<h4>Explore the Utilities Folder</h4>

<p>JAWS has several utilities that you can quickly access to view license information, configuration and settings files, and help topics. These provide shortcuts to your user settings, shared settings, and program files. There are two ways to open the Explore Utilities folder that I will show you now.</p>

<ul>
	<li>First, in the JAWS Utilities menu, look for Explore Utilities Folder. There it is.</li>
	<li>Or, from the Windows Search edit box, type "utilities," use <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to find the Utilities app for the version of JAWS you are using, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A File Explorer window opens with sixteen or so different utilities. We are only going to cover four of these here in the JAWS Basic Training. My main purpose with this exercise is to show you how to find the Utilities folder for JAWS, and then once you find it how to use a few of the more common settings that I think you may need someday. You may never need these but at least you know where they can be found.</p>

<h5>Braille Viewer</h5>

<p>I will press <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to select Braille Viewer. The JAWS Braille Viewer provides on the computer screen the textual representation of the output received on a refreshable braille device. The application is designed to simulate a braille display and operates with or without an actual braille display present. The main purpose of Braille Viewer is to assist sighted instructors or testers that do not read braille or may not have access to a braille display. It helps to demonstrate and confirm the output information JAWS sends to these hardware devices.</p>

<p>By default, Braille Viewer represents 40 cells if no braille display is installed, or if the default braille display is not connected or turned on. </p>

<p>When launched, an application desktop toolbar appears at the top of the screen and displays two lines. The top line contains a read-only edit field that displays in text form exactly what is being sent to the cells of a braille device. The second line contains the Braille Keys button, Exit button, and status line, which displays modes (line, structured, or speech box) and other significant information. Press the Braille Keys button to open a dialog box that shows a list of options commonly performed by pressing braille keys on a braille display, such as Pan Right or Pan Left. The toolbar can be moved to the top or the bottom of the screen, but it is designed so it cannot be hidden or covered by other windows.</p>

<p>Braille Viewer appears in the system tray and not the taskbar. Press <strong>INSERT+F11</strong> to access system tray icons without using a mouse.</p>

<p>Braille Viewer also closes when you close JAWS.</p>

<h5>Explore My Settings</h5>

<p>This folder contains your user-specific JAWS settings. When you create or modify Voice Profiles, Speech and Sounds schemes, or customize any global or application-specific settings, JAWS saves the settings in this folder. When you changed the voice rate for JAWS in the last lesson, this is where JAWS saved those changes.</p>

<h5>Explore the Manuals</h5>

<p>In this folder you will find the following documents:</p>

<ul>
	<li>JAWS Quick Start Guide in text, Word document, and PDF, or Portable Document Format.</li>
	<li>JAWS keystroke guides in Word document and text format.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Help</h5>

<p>The JAWS Help can be opened by going to the File menu in the JAWS user interface or by pressing <strong>F1</strong> from within the JAWS window. However, if you don't have JAWS running you can also find the JAWS Help in this folder. We will go into the JAWS Help in more detail in book eight of the JAWS Basic Training. For now, I'm going to go ahead and close the Utilities folder by pressing <strong>ALT+F4</strong>.</p>

<h4>Convenient OCR</h4>

<p>The Convenient OCR feature (Optical Character Recognition) enables you to access any image that contains textual information as part of the image with just a few simple keystrokes. Recognize the following with Convenient OCR:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Images captured using the Freedom Scientific PEARL&reg; reading camera or a flatbed scanner</li>
	<li>An image file selected in File Explorer</li>
	<li>An inaccessible PDF document selected in File Explorer</li>
	<li>An inaccessible PDF document currently open in Adobe Reader</li>
	<li>Images on the screen that may contain text, such as the setup window of an application or a menu of selections for a DVD movie</li>
</ul>

<p>To use Convenient OCR, the following layered keystrokes are available:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>INSERT+SPACEBAR, O, A</strong>. Recognizes images captured from a camera or scanner.</li>
	<li><strong>INSERT+SPACEBAR, O, F</strong>. Recognizes the currently selected image file.</li>
	<li><strong>INSERT+SPACEBAR, O, D</strong>. Recognizes the currently open PDF document.</li>
	<li><strong>INSERT+SPACEBAR, O, W</strong>. Recognizes the current application window that has focus.</li>
	<li><strong>INSERT+SPACEBAR, O, QUESTION MARK</strong>. Speaks a brief help message describing the commands available to you in the OCR layer.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on using Convenient OCR, please visit the JAWS Help.</p>

<h4>Picture Smart for Describing Images with JAWS</h4>

<p>Picture Smart allows you to choose a photo and submit it to be analyzed. A description of the image is then displayed in the JAWS Results Viewer window. Descriptions might include details such as the number of people in the photo, recognizable landmarks, landscape details such as "outdoors with a blue sky and green grass," if there are vehicles such as automobiles or trains, and more. If there is text in the picture, it will OCR the text and provide that as well.</p>

<p>Press <strong>INSERT+SPACEBAR</strong> followed by <strong>P</strong> to use Picture Smart. Once the Picture Smart layer is active, the following keystrokes are available:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>A</strong> - Open the Picture Smart dialog box where you can acquire an image from a flatbed scanner or the Freedom Scientific PEARL camera.</li>
	<li><strong>F</strong> - Describes the currently selected image in File Explorer.</li>
	<li><strong>C</strong> - Describes an image associated with the current control, for example, a graphic on a web page or in an email message.</li>
	<li><strong>B</strong> - Describes the contents of the Windows Clipboard if it contains an image.</li>
	<li><strong>QUESTION MARK</strong> - Displays help for the Picture Smart layer.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a new Picture Smart folder where you can save an image, and have it automatically submitted for analyzing and display the resulting description. To access this folder, press <strong>WINDOWS Key+E</strong> to open File Explorer, open the Pictures folder, and then open the PictureSmart folder.</p>

<p>To use Picture Smart, the "submit anonymous usage data" option must be enabled in Settings Center. This sends encrypted information to Freedom Scientific. The images from Picture Smart are then submitted to the various services (such as Microsoft and Google) which analyze the images and returns the descriptions back to us. These descriptions are then displayed in the Results Viewer. If you attempt to use Picture Smart and this setting is off, a message displays prompting you to turn it on.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Picture Smart is currently only available while in the English Language user interface of JAWS as the services that perform the image analysis do not currently support international languages for the descriptions of images. We plan to make Picture Smart available in more languages in the future as these services continue to expand to include additional languages.</p>

<h3>Language Menu</h3>

<p>The JAWS Language menu allows you to open a submenu of language version choices for JAWS. This submenu is not available in English only versions of JAWS.</p>

<p>I will press <strong>ALT+L</strong>, and I will press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>.</p>

<p>The Voice Profiles submenu here offers another way to switch between voice profiles or get to the Voice Adjustment dialog box via the Create New menu item. Remember, you can always press <strong>INSERT+ALT+S</strong> to switch voice profiles without having to go into the menus.</p>

<h4>Using JAWS with No Speech</h4>

<p>One of the items in the Language, Voice Profiles submenu is called No Speech. Why might one want to use JAWS without speech? Some people may use refreshable braille displays and may prefer to read the braille as opposed to listening to speech. At other times you might just want to silence JAWS temporarily while you are doing something else. Instead of going to the menus to do this, there is a JAWS layered command to toggle speech on and off. Use the keystroke <strong>INSERT+SPACEBAR</strong> first, followed by the letter <strong>S</strong> to toggle speech on or off. If JAWS is silent, just press the key combination again to start speech.</p>

<p>For now, I am going to press <strong>ESC</strong> a couple of times to get out of the menus.</p>

<h3>Help Menu</h3>

<p>The Help menu contains quite a few options, and we will not cover them all in the Basic Training. For those that are not covered in the Basic Training, please visit the JAWS Help system for more information. I will press <strong>ALT+H</strong> to go to the Help menu in JAWS. The ones I want to discuss include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Commands Search</strong> - We covered JAWS Commands Search in book two of the JAWS Basic Training. I am just going to press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> to move through the menus.</li>
	<li><strong>Training</strong> - This opens the FSReader DAISY player which is included with JAWS. A table of contents for available training materials is the first page that presents itself when FSReader is started from the Training menu. If the training materials are not installed and you have an internet connection, updated DAISY training books are downloaded and installed seamlessly and easily.</li>
	<li><strong>JAWS Help Topics</strong> - The JAWS Help system is covered in book eight of the JAWS Basic Training.</li>
	<li><strong>The Web Resources submenu</strong> - This contains links to the JAWS Headquarters, Technical Support web page, Surfing the Internet training pages, Fusion Magnification, Training Headquarters, Free Training Webinars, the Freedom Scientific home page, and the FSCast homepage. If you can't remember how to get to various resources we have available, just check this handy submenu!</li>
	<li><strong>Technical Support</strong> - This opens to the JAWS Help system page where you can find contact information for our technical support team.</li>
	<li><strong>About JAWS</strong> - This gives your version and serial number of JAWS, as well as other useful information such as the number of upgrades you have remaining under your SMA, or Software Maintenance Agreement, if you have one.</li>
	<li><strong>Startup Wizard</strong> - We covered the Startup Wizard in book three of the JAWS Basic Training.</li>
	<li><strong>Check for Updates</strong> - This allows you to tell JAWS to see if there are any new updates available. By default, any time a new update is available JAWS should automatically notify you. However, you can check manually here.</li>
</ul>

<p>For now, let's press <strong>ESC</strong> a few times to close the menus. Thanks for joining me in book four of the JAWS Basic Training!</p>
